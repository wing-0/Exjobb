  comment  = {Builds upon Lawrence2001 for the theory and Buerkle2008 for numerical simulations.

The article describes nondestructive evaluation using both electromagnetics and acoustics. The way this is done is by exciting the target (in this case a dielectric cylinder, but any geometry should be possible according to the authors) acoustically and imaging it electromagnetically. The target must resonate acoustically as this affects the electromagnetic waves by causing a Doppler shift in the scattered field. The Doppler component of the scattered field is highly sensitive to the shape of the acoustic resonance mode, and if there is a flaw in the target this can be measured as the acoustic mode then changes. The signal processing part is described more than the acousto-electromagnetic theory (time-reversal focusing is used), but this is less relevant to me.

The relevance to our application:

1. It might be possible to use the method described as is if acoustic resonance is obtained. However, there might be difficulties with using the existing mm-wave imaging together with this (more research is required to determine this). Also, the acoustic properties of honeycomb nomex composites are quite complex, so it may not be an efficient way forward due to this.

2. The concept of acoustic resonance might be necessary to look into more even if another approach is taken with the imaging. If the acoustic properties of the sample are correct for it, resonance might occur in the sample. A more acousto-optical approach only takes into account the density modulation inside the sample (this is one of the two mechanisms described in the paper). An object in resonance should also have the second mechanism of surface movement being strong, which is not considered in acousto-optics.

3. Would it be possible to excite the defects into acoustic resonance? That would be more like the ground penetrating radar described somewhat in Lawrence2001.},

This is a review on different acoustic-optical tomography methods in medicine. Much of the paper discusses topics very unrelated to my work (specific ways of utilizing the interaction medically, optical detection methods etc.). The relevant parts might be the interaction mechanisms.

All mechanisms of acousto-optical interaction are not necessarily relevant for my work. They present three mechanisms: one where ultrasound displaces scatterers which causes phase change in the light, one where ultrasound changes the index of refraction which causes phase change in the light, and one where ultrasound modulates the density which changes optical properties of the material. The third mechanism is very general and can be seen in many other texts such as Fundamentals of Photonics and the Michigan papers (Lawrence2001, Buerkle2008-2009). The two first mechanisms however, might not be as relevant to this work as it is to medical applications. The reason behind this is that while optical frequencies might scatter against molecules and other small-scale objects which can be displaced and such, these scatterers are too small to affect mm-waves in the same way. However, this should be explored further by reading more on those two interaction mechanisms.

Especially the reference list could be important since it contains a lot.},

The method is based around imaging permittivity in a sample. It seems like they use two measurements: one with only electromagnetism and one with both acoustics and electromagnetism. The second measurement is where the acoustic waves alter the distribution of permittivity inside of the sample. Based upon these measurements it is somehow possible to recover the unperturbed permittivity distribution with a higher resolution than a standard electromagnetic-only measurement would give.

I can't find much information on interaction mechanisms in the paper, probably because they don't really rely on measuring the acousto-electromagnetic interaction directly (although this might be the case, but only hidden behind a massive amount of notation). The main mechanism is based on acoustic waves altering the permittivity, but I can't find anything more clear than that. While other papers usually look directly at a frequency shift caused by the interaction, this paper has a less direct method.

I'm very unsure if the methods described here are even applicable to our problem. Need to read this paper more times to be even close to answering that.},

  comment       = {PhD thesis by Buerkle. The subject is the same as other articles from Radiation Laboratory at Univ. of Michigan.

Since this is a thesis it contains much more information than the journal articles, and also more references.

Section 1.4 has a good overview of previous work where I can probably find good references.

Section 2.2 on tumour detection has lots of info on different ways ultrasound is used, and how it could be used together with EM waves. For example, ultrasound might be used to get depth resolution in samples which are not thin sheets (this was one other possible path for a thesis I could take within this project so it seems relevant). The possibility of using localized harmonic motion (as used in vibro-acoustography) is also explored.

Section 2.3 discusses non destrutive evaluation, which is obviously of interest. The background is discussed more than in Buerkle2009, but the method is the same.

In the later chapters it is much more focused on the specific implementation of their model. This is less relevant now in the beginning of my work than the general information in the earlier parts.},

  abstract = {Abstract The mechanism generating the array-distributed atmospheric refractivity fluctuation by a coherent acoustic source is analyzed. The theoretical model is established, which is used to quantifiably analyze the array structure of the artificial dielectric irregularities. It is qualitatively validated that the array-distributed artificial dielectric irregularities really exist and that the array structure of the artificial dielectric irregularities and the scattering effect of the artificial dielectric irregularities on a radio wave can be controlled by adjusting and selecting the optimized parameters of the transmitted acoustic wave and the adopted acoustic antenna array. It can be concluded that the array-distributed artificial dielectric irregularities can be used to purposefully affect radio wave propagation. After radio acoustic sounding system, the idea of this paper is a novel development in the field of the tropospheric atmospheric refractivity artificial abnormality technique and its applications.},

Very interesting since the results from vibrating targets show that the frequency shift should vary with time, something that has not been stated in any of the articles on resonating objects. Maybe this is due to the fact that the derivation here uses point scatterers? Or maybe it has to do with what they actually mean when they say that the scatterer is rotating? Need to find more information on this so I can see what is actually the correct way of thinking here.},
