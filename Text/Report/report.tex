	\section{Background}
	\todoext{Introduce the subject from a starting point in non-destructive testing and aerospace materials. Bring up the two separate fields of ultrasonic testing and microwave imaging. Different acousto-electromagnetism perspectives such as acousto-optics, RASS, micro-Doppler effect in radar (for vibrations).}
	Aerospace materials are some of the most demanding in terms of quality and safety, so inspection is crucial to guarantee defect-free components \addref. Since defects can be located inside of materials it is necessary to detect these without having to compromise the structural integrity of the components \addref. For this task non-destructive testing (NDT) has been utilized in aerospace manufacturing since \todo{since when?}. Some of the earliest NDT techniques are radiographic testing using x-rays and ultrasonic testing \addref \todo{More methods?}. Modern materials science has supplied many new types of composites useful in aerospace construction. Stronger, lighter and lower radar cross-section are just some examples of better material properties for civilian and military aerospace applications \addref. To still be able to keep reliability high, NDT techniques are required to keep up with the advances in materials science \addref. Some techniques have struggled with modern materials such as radiographic testing which is more suitable to traditional aluminum components \addref.
	
	One NDT technique which has become more popular relatively recently is microwave and mm-wave imaging \addref. Technical advances in microwave electronics together with better data processing performance has made this field increasingly attractive \addref. \todo{Relation to aerospace}
	
	\section{Related Work}
	\todoext{List other work related to this. The paper detailing the mm-wave imaging system developed at EIT should probably be here. Other related work might be development by Top et.al. (HMMDI) for localized harmonic motion, Russian (Soviet) derivations of the acousto-optic-like theory from basic EM. Probably even more.}
	
	\section{Purpose and Goals}
	Three goals were set up before starting the work in the form of questions to be answered by the thesis:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item How does acousto-electromagnetic interaction differ from acousto-optic theory with wavelengths in the same order of magnitude?
		\item What properties do acoustic and electromagnetic waves have in homogeneous materials and laminated composites?
		\item How can ultrasound improve mm-wave imaging of defects in composites?
	\end{enumerate}
	The goals were not written in a very specific way due to them being decided before a thorough review of the literature. However, during the literature review process more information was obtained and the goals were appended with more specific questions and sub-goals.

	\section{Nondestructive Testing Techniques}
	Nondestructive testing has been ... In industries with high demands for quality and safety, NDT is often a necessity. Aerospace is such an industry and has utilized NDT for a long time. \addref Modern aircraft increasingly use composite materials due to superior properties such as low weight \cite{Katunin2015}. The difference of these materials when compared with traditional metal structures requires changes in the NDT procedures \cite{Riegert2006}. One old technique which is used widely for aerospace composites is ultrasonic testing \cite{Garnier2011}. Another technique which has been developed more recently than ultrasonic testing is microwave/mm-wave imaging, which may hold promises in various NDT applications \cite{Kharkovsky2007}.

	\section{Acousto-EM in Established Technology}
	Interaction between acoustics and electromagnetism has been known of for a long time \addref. Beyond knowledge of the phenomena there are also applications in technology which are investigated in this section. Two examples are given: acousto-optics and the Radio Acoustic Sounding System. These operate at very different frequencies (both acoustic and electromagnetic) which can be of interest when investigating the possibility of using mm-wave frequencies.

	\subsection{Radio Acoustic Sounding System}
	One application of acousto-electromagnetic interaction can be found in meteorology through the Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS). The purpose of the system is to utilize the interaction between radio and acoustic waves for temperature sounding of the atmosphere \todoint{Find some nice review article or something}.
	This mechanism has not only been used in optics, but also in radio meteorology through the Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) \cite{Buerkle2007}. This indicates that the wavelength dependence described above can be offset by other factors to still give a measurable scattered signal. The system is used for temperature sounding since the speed of sound depends on temperature. The Bragg scattering condition is thus affected by a temperature change \cite{Marshall1972}. The systems are usually designed with electromagnetic and acoustic wave sources approximately co-located \cite{Marshall1972}.

	\section{Overview of Interaction Mechanisms}
	To introduce the subject, four types of interaction mechanisms between acoustic and electromagnetic waves are presented. This is by no means a complete list of possible ways of combining the phenomena. Instead, these mechanisms are those which could be found in the literature relatively easily.
	
	\subsection{Target Boundary Perturbation}
	This mechanism is based on a discrete target under acoustic resonance. The resonance of the target leads to vibration, which is seen as a time-dependent boundary perturbation \cite{Buerkle2007}. This is seen in the scattered signal as a frequency shift by the vibration frequency \cite{Sarabandi2003}.
	\todoext{There should be a little more details here. Also a description on why this is not used later on in the work.}
	
	\subsection{Localized Harmonic Motion}
	\todoext{This part should be larger than those of other interaction mechanisms since it is only presented here.}
	Interaction based on Localized Harmonic Motion is similar to the previous one based on boundary perturbation in that it uses scattering from harmonic motion. The difference is that harmonic motion is introduced in a bulk material instead of a resonating discrete target. The acoustic part of the mechanism has been utilized in the medical methods of vibro-acoustography and harmonic motion imaging \cite{Wang2018}. Both techniques use amplitude modulated ultrasound to produce a time-harmonic acoustic radiation force in a localized region of a sample. This force then generates time-harmonic displacement, or vibration. In the acoustic methods the vibrating region emits acoustic waves which can be detected \cite{Fatemi1998}\cite{Konofagou2003}.
	
	An electromagnetic wave incident towards the vibrating region will scatter with a frequency shift which corresponds to the frequency of vibration \cite{Top2014}. This is very similar to the boundary perturbation mechanism described before.
	
	\subsubsection{Acoustic Radiation Force}
	\todoext{Description on how acoustic radiation force works and how it is possible to cause vibrations inside an object using this}
	
	\subsubsection{The Micro-Doppler Effect}
	\todoext{This needs to be rewritten quite a bit}
	The frequency shift mentioned earlier is due to the micro-Doppler effect, which describes effects of targets with rotation or vibration \cite{Buerkle2007}. A vibrating target then causes frequency modulation of the scattered electromagnetic wave. \cite{Chen2006}. For a stationary target this corresponds to a signal with a strong frequency component at $f_\mrm{c}$ and weaker sidebands at $f_\mrm{c} \pm n f_\mrm{v}$ where $n=1$ are the strongest (carrier frequency $f_\mrm{c}$, variation frequency $f_\mrm{v}$, positive integers $n$). The amplitudes of the spectral lines are given by Bessel functions $J_n(B)$, where $B \sim (4\pi/\lambda)D_\mrm{v}$ \cite{Chen2006}. $D_\mrm{v}$ is the amplitude of vibration which is usually small (on the order of $\mu$m) \cite{Buerkle2007}\cite{Top2014}. For small values of $B$ the central component will dominate, and the first Doppler component will be much more prominent than the others. Therefore it makes sense that this first component is the one considered in the literature \cite{Buerkle2007}.
	
%	There are two methods of generating radiation force locally. The first method uses amplitude modulated focused ultrasound with its focus on the region of interest \cite{Top2016}. Since amplitude modulated ultrasound exists throughout the beam a force is generated in that entire region. However, the intensity is much higher in the focus so the force is stronger there. The second method instead uses two single-frequency ultrasonic beams which intersect at the region of interest. The frequencies of the two beams differ by a small amount $\Delta \Omega$. Superposition at the intersection will then generate localized amplitude modulation by half the difference frequency $\Delta \Omega/2$. However, the acoustic radiation force is determined by the energy density of the wave. This is proportional to the square of the acoustic field, which changes the frequency of interest by a factor 2. The frequency of the acoustic radiation force is then the difference frequency $\Delta \Omega$ \cite{Fatemi1998}.
	
	\subsection{Acousto-Optics}
	Acousto-optics is an interaction mechanism often explained using simple elasticity models and wave optics \cite{Saleh2007}\cite{Korpel1981}. The main idea is that there is a relation between the strain in a material and its index of refraction. Since an acoustic wave consists of periodic compression and rarefaction in a medium (which can be related to strain), a consequence is that the index of refraction varies with the same period \cite{Saleh2007}. This periodic structure of varying index of refraction acts as a Bragg reflector scattering incident light \cite{Saleh2007}. The Bragg condition determines the angle of incidence $\theta_\mrm{B}$ required for the light
	\begin{equation*}
		\sin{\theta_\mrm{B}} = \frac{\lambda}{2\Lambda}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\lambda$ is the light wavelength and $\Lambda$ is the acoustic wavelength \cite{Saleh2007}. As for the previously mentioned mechanisms, the scattered wave is frequency shifted by the acoustic frequency \cite{Korpel1988}.
	
	There is nothing in the basic theory suggesting that optical frequencies are required for this interaction. At microwave frequencies permittivity is more common to use than index of refraction, but they are related and the principle is the same. An application which uses this principle and has been used for many years is the radio acoustic sounding system \cite{Buerkle2007}. Additionally, though not using the exact Bragg formulation for modeling interaction, some authors have explored other ways of using similar interaction at microwave frequencies \cite{Lawrence2001}\cite{Merkel2006}. It has been stated, however, that this interaction is very small and resonance is often required (giving rise to boundary perturbation) \cite{Buerkle2007}.
	
	It is common to assume near-perpendicularity between the acoustic and electromagnetic wavevectors in acousto-optic theory \cite{Korpel1988}. For modeling at other angles, which makes for other wavelength ratios through the Bragg conditions, this interaction mechanism is studied further. A full electromagnetic model based on Maxwell's equations will be presented in section \ref{sec:analytical-scatter}.
	
	\subsection{Scatterer Displacement}
	This is a mechanism mostly presented in the field of ultrasound-optical tomography (UOT). The mechanism is based on dynamic multiple scattering of light, which occurs if many scatterers undergoing Brownian motion are considered \cite{Leutz1995}. If an ultrasonic beam is incident on such a sample the scatterers will move due to both Brownian motion and ultrasound, giving rise to a frequency shift in affected photons \cite{Leutz1995}\cite{Elson2011}. In medical applications, movement of the scatterers due to acoustic waves is very straight-forward: their displacement directly follows the acoustic wave \cite{Leutz1995}. This might well be the case for small scatterers which are then part of the wave, but for larger scatterers it gets more complicated. In that case, acoustic radiation force has to be considered for scatterer movement \cite{Torr1984}. \todoint{Double check some things on movement of small vs. big scatterers}
	
	For this work, a mechanism needs to be relevant at microwave frequencies to be considered. The assumption on which the theory rests is that of dynamic multiple light scattering \cite{Leutz1995}. In the existing mm-wave imaging system there is an assumption of sparse defects being the only scatterers \cite{Helander2017}. This is in complete contrast to the theory of dynamic multiple light scattering, which is based on a large number of moving scatterers \cite{Leutz1995}. Since the basic assumptions of the problem and theory are in such stark contrast, it seems likely that this interaction mechanism holds little relevance to the problem at hand.
	
	\subsection{Main Subjects of Interest}
	\todoext{Not correct since localized harmonic motion was moved up to only be in the overview}
	The mechanisms presented above were the major ones found in a wide search of the literature. Of the four presented, two could be ruled out for not being applicable to the problem of interest. The ``Localized Harmonic Motion'' and ``Acousto-Optics'' interaction mechanisms are presented in further detail later in this chapter.
	
	\section{Ultrasonic Wave Propagation}
	\todoint[inline]{Maybe write about how the word acoustics is sometimes used for wave propagation in both fluids and solids. And sometimes it is only considered to be the fluid case, while the solid case is called elastodynamics, elastic waves or something like that}
	This subject is of interest to both phenomena of localized harmonic motion and photoelastic interaction. Since ultrasound is used for some type of interaction with electromagnetic waves, it is important to understand that part of the problem. In many NDT applications the ultrasonic waves are generated in some transducer, coupled into a fluid medium and then coupled further into the solid medium of the test object \cite{Schmerr2016}. This requires knowledge of wave propagation in both fluid and solid media, which requires two different approaches: acoustics and elastodynamics.
	
	\subsection{Propagation in a Fluid Medium}
	In a compressible fluid ultrasound can be described by a fully acoustic model. The main variable for describing the wave motion is pressure in this case. In turn, this can be converted into other variables such as displacement or strain. The theory of acoustics originates in continuum mechanics, but a restriction to fluids and a linearization leads to the most commonly used model - linear acoustics \cite{Rossing2014}. The acoustic wave equation which lies at the heart of the model of linear acoustics can be written as \cite{Rossing2014, Schmerr2016, Kaufman2000}
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = 0
		\label{eq:th-ac-wave}
	\end{equation}
	where $p$ is pressure and $v$ is the speed of sound in the fluid. In addition to linearization, this equation assumes no body forces and a homogeneous density of the medium \cite{Rossing2014}. The speed of sound can be written as $v = \sqrt{K/\rho_0}$ where $K$ is the bulk modulus of the fluid and $\rho_0$ is the unperturbed density of the fluid \cite{Kaufman2000}.
	
	This model is directly useful for NDT in some cases. One is in immersion testing, where a test object is immersed in water and ultrasound propagates through the water into the object \cite{Schmerr2016}. The other is in coupling ultrasound from a transducer to an object through a thin layer of coupling fluid \cite{Schmerr2016}. However, this model is also useful for understanding one special case of propagation in an elastic solid, namely p-wave propagation \cite{Rossing2014}. This will be described further in the next part.
	
	While the pressure is the main quantity describing acoustic waves in a fluid, one of the more common quantities is instead sound pressure level (SPL). This is a relative quantity measured in dB, which is defined as
	\begin{equation*}
		L_\mrm{p} = 20 \log_{10}{\frac{p}{p_\mrm{ref}}}
	\end{equation*}
	where $p_\mrm{ref}$ is a reference pressure which is defined as 20 $\mu$Pa in air \cite{Rossing2014}. For ultrasound it is sometimes more common to use acoustic intensity instead of pressure or SPL, especially if the propagation is not in air \addref. This is defined as the acoustic power per unit area \cite{Rossing2014}. An instantaneous value for this is
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{I}(t) = p(t) \bm{v}_\mrm{part}(t)
	\end{equation*}
	where $\bm{v}_\mrm{part}(t)$ is the particle velocity \cite{Rossing2014}. However, it is more common to use the time-average value \cite{Jacobsen1991}. For plane waves, a relation for this can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		I_\mrm{s} = \frac{p_\mrm{p}^2}{2\rho_0 v}
	\end{equation*}
	where $p_\mrm{p}$ is the peak pressure amplitude of the plane wave, $\rho_0$ is the density and $v$ the acoustic wave speed \cite{Rossing2014}. One thing to note is that this is a scalar, and not a vector as before. The direction in this case is understood to be the same as the propagation direction of the plane wave \cite{Rossing2014}. Related to acoustic intensity is the sound intensity level (SIL), which is analogous to SPL. This is measured in dB and defined as
	\begin{equation*}
		L_\mrm{I} = 10 \log_{10}{\frac{I_\mrm{s}}{I_\mrm{s,ref}}}
	\end{equation*}
	where $I_\mrm{s,ref}$ is a reference intensity which is defined as $10^{-12}$ W/m$^2$ in air \cite{Rossing2014}.
	
	\subsection{Propagation in a Solid Medium \label{sec:th-prop-solid}}
	\todoext{Might be good to add a brief introduction to the quantities of continuum mechanics and how they are related to each other}
	In an elastic medium the acoustic model is no longer sufficient. The linear acoustic model considers only pressure since one main assumption for volume elements in the fluid is that they only transmit force in the direction of the force \cite{Kaufman2000}. The volume elements in an elastic solid are more strongly coupled to each other, and this assumption does not hold anymore \cite{Kaufman2005}. The equations for elastic waves are instead based on solid mechanics. There is no simple wave equation as in acoustics, instead the model is described by Navier's equations
	\begin{equation*}
		\mu \nabla^2 \bm{u} + (\lambda+\mu) \nabla (\nabla \cdot \bm{u}) + \bm{f} = \rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 \bm{u}}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\bm{u}$ is the displacement vector, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Lamé parameters of the material and $\bm{f}$ is the body force \cite{Schmerr2016}. To obtain wave equations from this, a Helmholtz decomposition is made as
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{u} = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \bm{\psi}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\phi$ is a scalar potential and $\bm{\psi}$ is a vector potential \cite{Schmerr2016}. For Navier's equations to be fulfilled, the following must hold for the potentials \cite{Schmerr2016}:
	\begin{align*}
		&\nabla^2 \phi - \frac{1}{c_\mrm{p}^2} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = 0 \\
		&\nabla^2 \bm{\psi} - \frac{1}{c_\mrm{s}^2} \frac{\partial^2 \bm{\psi}}{\partial t^2} = 0
	\end{align*}
	These are two wave equations with the wave speeds \cite{Schmerr2016}
	\begin{align*}
		c_\mrm{p} &= \sqrt{(\lambda + 2\mu)/\rho_0} \\
		c_\mrm{s} &= \sqrt{\mu/\rho_0}
	\end{align*}
	By further investigation, the waves can be identified as p-waves with speed $c_\mrm{p}$ and s-waves with speed $c_\mrm{s}$ \cite{Schmerr2016}. The p-waves are very similar to acoustic waves in fluids, and it can be shown that the dilatation of the solid (the sum of linear strains, $\nabla \cdot \bm{u}$) travels at $c_\mrm{p}$ \cite{Schmerr2016}. The s-waves on the other hand, do not have an analogy in fluid acoustics. The local rotation of the solid (half the curl of the displacement vector, $(\nabla \times \bm{u})/2$) follows the s-wave equation \cite{Schmerr2016}. This local rotation is always zero in fluid acoustics due to the weak coupling between volume elements \cite{Kaufman2000}, so s-waves cannot propagate in fluids. When it comes to actually generating ultrasonic elastic waves, transducers are available both for generation of p-waves and s-waves \cite{Schmerr2016}.
	
	One important detail when working with solid materials capable of supporting both p- and s-waves is that conversion between the two is possible \cite{Schmerr2016}. Mode conversion is a phenomena where even pure p-waves will generate a combination of p- and s-waves. Whenever a p-wave is incident at an interface at oblique angles, mode conversion will take place \cite{Schmerr2016}.
	
	The elastic waves described above are called bulk waves since they are only fully describe waves in the bulk of an elastic solid \cite{Kaufman2005}. Other wave phenomena exist such as surface waves (Rayleigh, Stoneley, Love) \cite{Kaufman2005} and plate waves (SH, Lamb) \cite{Schmerr2016}. These waves are not insignificant and are used in some branches of ultrasonic testing \cite{Schmerr2016}. However, only bulk waves are considered here.
	
	To be able to easily relate elastic p-waves to acoustic waves in fluids, a relation between pressure and dilatation is required. In a fluid at rest, the pressure can be related to the linear stresses in the Cauchy stress tensor as \cite{Irgens2008}
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{xz} \\
			\sigma_{yx} & \sigma_{yy} & \sigma_{yz} \\
			\sigma_{zx} & \sigma_{zy} & \sigma_{zz}
		\end{pmatrix}
		=
		\begin{pmatrix}
		-p & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & -p & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & -p
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\sigma_{ab}$ are stress components written in Cartesian coordinates. All linear stresses are equal for that case, which does not hold in general. However, the pressure can still be related to the Cauchy stress tensor for cases where linear stresses are not equal (and even in solids) by \cite{Bertram2015}
	\begin{equation*}
		p = -\frac{1}{3}(\sigma_{xx} + \sigma_{yy} + \sigma_{zz})
	\end{equation*}
	which is just the mean value of the linear stresses. For an isotropic solid, these can be written using Lamé parameters and displacements as \cite{Schmerr2016}
	\begin{align*}
		\sigma_{xx} &= \lambda \nabla \cdot \bm{u} + 2\mu \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} \\
		\sigma_{yy} &= \lambda \nabla \cdot \bm{u} + 2\mu \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} \\
		\sigma_{zz} &= \lambda \nabla \cdot \bm{u} + 2\mu \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}
	\end{align*}
	The pressure can then be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		p &= -\frac{1}{3} \left(
			\lambda \nabla \cdot \bm{u} + 2\mu \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}
			+ \lambda \nabla \cdot \bm{u} + 2\mu \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}
			+ \lambda \nabla \cdot \bm{u} + 2\mu \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}
		\right) \\
		&= -\left(
			\lambda \nabla \cdot \bm{u} + \frac{2\mu}{3} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right)
		\right) = - \left( \lambda + \frac{2\mu}{3} \right) \nabla \cdot \bm{u}
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	The Lamé parameters are related to the bulk modulus by $K = \lambda + 2\mu/3$ \cite{Irgens2008} which simplifies the equation above to
	\begin{equation}
		p = -K \nabla \cdot \bm{u}
		\label{eq:th-pressure-from-displ}
	\end{equation}
	With this it is straight-forward to calculate the pressure for a given displacement. The dilatation follows the wave equation with the p-wave speed \cite{Schmerr2016}
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2 (\nabla \cdot \bm{u}) - \frac{1}{c_\mrm{p}^2} \frac{\partial^2 (\nabla \cdot \bm{u})}{\partial t^2} = 0
	\end{equation*}
	If equation \eqref{eq:th-pressure-from-displ} is inserted, and the wave equation is multiplied by $-K$, the result is
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{c_\mrm{p}^2} \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} = 0
	\end{equation*}
	This is the same as the acoustic wave equation in fluids \eqref{eq:th-ac-wave}, with the exception of the wave speeds which are $v = \sqrt{K/\rho_0} = \sqrt{(\lambda + 2\mu/3)/\rho_0}$ for fluid acoustic waves and $c_\mrm{p} = \sqrt{(\lambda + 2\mu)/\rho_0}$ for p-waves.
	
%	If instead the displacement is unknown, it is easier to use the equation \cite{Schmerr2016}
%	\begin{equation*}
%		-\nabla p + \bm{f} = \rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 \bm{u}}{\partial t^2}
%	\end{equation*}
%	If the body force is set to zero, $\bm{f} = \bm{0}$, and indefinite integration is done twice with respect to time the result is
%	\begin{equation}
%	\bm{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho_0} \iint \nabla p \, \mathrm{d}t \mathrm{d}t
%	\label{eq:th-displ-from-pressure}
%	\end{equation}
%	This calculation obviously depends on both the space- and time-dependencies of the pressure field.
	
	\section{Photoelasticity}
	\todoint[inline]{Add all other names such as strain-optic, elasto-optic}
	To understand how the interaction between the two wave phenomena works, the first step is to understand how an acoustic or elastic wave affects electromagnetic properties. The theory of photoelasticity relates strains from linear elasticity with the relative permittivity of a material. With a starting point in solid mechanics, a tensor-based theory is somewhat inevitable. However, a simplified model is shown later which condenses the tensor relations down to a scalar relation.
	
	A starting point can be found in the literature on acousto-optics in the relation \cite{Korpel1988}
	\begin{equation*}
		\Delta \left( \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) = p_{ij} s_j
	\end{equation*}
	where $s_j$ are strains and $i,j = 1,\dotsc,6$. The double indexation of $j$ in both $p$ and $e$ indicates a summation over $j$. The notation $\Delta \alpha$ indicates the difference between a perturbed quantity $\alpha$ and its unperturbed value. Since refractive index and relative permittivity are related by $\varepsilon_{r_i} = n_i^2$ in a non-magnetic material, the relation is rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
	\Delta \left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}} \right) = p_{ij} s_j
	\end{equation*}
	The LHS is the difference of an inverse quantity, which is cumbersome to use. To find $\Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}$ instead of $\Delta(1/\varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i})$ it is assumed that the difference $\Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}$ is small when compared with the non-perturbed value $\varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}$. With that assumption, the difference $\Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}$ is approximated as a differential. This allows use of the chain rule as
	\begin{equation*}
		\Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i} \approx \mrm{d} \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i} = \frac{\mrm{d} \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}}{\mrm{d} \alpha} \mrm{d} \alpha \approx \frac{\mrm{d} \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}}{\mrm{d} \alpha} \Delta \alpha
	\end{equation*}
	where $\alpha$ is some variable with a small difference $\Delta \alpha \approx \mrm{d} \alpha$. If $\alpha$ is selected as $\alpha = 1/\varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}$ this leads to
	\begin{equation*}
		\Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i} \approx \frac{\mrm{d}\varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}}{\mrm{d}\alpha} \Delta \alpha = - 1/\alpha \Delta \alpha = - \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}^2 p_{ij} s_j
	\end{equation*}
	
	The tensor notation used above is a simplified form described by the 1949 IRE standards. The relation to full tensor notation is shown below for an arbitrary tensor $a$ \cite{Korpel1988}
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		a_1 &= a_{11},\ a_2 = a_{22},\ a_3 = a_{33}, \\
		a_4 &= a_{23},\ a_5 = a_{31},\ a_6 = a_{12}
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	If the strains are considered, it is clear that indices 1-3 are tensile and 4-6 are shear. For the photoelastic tensor it can be seen that it is of rank 4, being $p_{ijkl}$ in standard notation. One thing to note is that the 4 indices in standard notation should allow for many more components of the photoelastic tensor than those possible using this compact notation (81 instead of 36). This is due to symmetry of the photoelastic tensor in this particular model. \addref It should also be noted that this model does break down in some cases, and more advanced descriptions of the phenomena exist \cite{Nelson1971}. However, this model was considered advanced enough as a starting point for this problem, especially since it is quite heavily simplified in the end.
	
	This model of the photoelastic tensor allows for up to 36 independent components, but for the simple case of an isotropic solid the tensor simplifies to \cite{Korpel1988}
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		p_{11} &= p_{22} = p_{33}, \ p_{12} = p_{21} = p_{13} = p_{23} = p_{32}\\
		p_{44} &= p_{55} = p_{66} = \frac{1}{2} (p_{11} - p_{12}), \ p_{ij} = 0 \text{ for others}
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	
	The simplest material to consider would be an isotropic solid with isotropic permittivity $\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$. There is then no preferred axis and a coordinate system can be selected arbitrarily. A longitudinal strain wave is defined by \begin{equation*}
		s_1(x_1,t) = s_\mrm{p} \cos(\Omega t - qx_1)
	\end{equation*}
	It is propagating in the $x_1$ direction and is thus a strain $e_1$, and all other strains are assumed to be zero. The relation $\Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i} = -\varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i}^2 p_{ij} s_j$ together with the photoelastic tensor for isotropic solids then gives
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_1} &= -\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 p_{11} s_\mrm{p} \cos(\Omega t - qx_1)\\
		\Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_2} &= \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_3} = -\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 p_{12} s_\mrm{p} \cos(\Omega t - qx_1)
	\end{align*}
	It is clear that the permittivity now has an axis $x_1$ where it has another value than in $x_2$ and $x_3$. So even for a material which is nominally completely isotropic, a preferred axis arises for the permittivity! This type of anisotropy is called birefringence in optics, and in this case it is caused by dipoles aligning themselves parallel to the strain \cite{Korpel1988}. Practically, the effect of this is that the interaction strength of this mechanism depends on the EM polarization with respect to the acoustic wave polarization. In longitudinal acoustic waves the polarization and propagation direction coincide, which makes analysis easier.
	
	For a very simplistic model, the anisotropy can be ignored if it is assumed that $p_{11} = p_{12}$. This assumption reduces the photoelastic tensor to
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		p_{11} &= p_{22} = p_{33} = p_{12} = p_{21} = p_{13} = p_{23} = p_{32} = \mathfrak{p}\\
		p_{ij} &= 0 \text{ for others}
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\mathfrak{p}$ was introduced as a scalar photoelastic constant. One thing to note is that since $p_{33} = p_{44} = p_{55} = 0$, shear strain does not have any effect in this simplified model. If the unperturbed permittivity is isotropic ($\varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_1} = \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_2} = \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_3} = \varepsilon_r$, $\varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_i} = 0$ for $i=4,5,6$) a scalar relation can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\varepsilon_1 = -\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p} (s_1 + s_2 + s_3)
	\end{equation*}
	Here $\varepsilon_1$ was introduced as the isotropic change in relative permittivity, $\varepsilon_1 = \Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_1} = \Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_2} = \Delta \varepsilon_{\mrm{r}_3}$. At this stage it is more practical to use Cartesian coordinates than index notation since much other theory uses that convention. Vector notation is also used when appropriate. Using this convention, it follows that
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\varepsilon_1 &= -\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p} (s_{xx} + s_{yy} + s_{zz}) = -\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right) \\
		&= -\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p} (\nabla \cdot \bm{u})
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:th-PE-scalar}
	\end{equation}
	Using equation \eqref{eq:th-pressure-from-displ} this relation can now be expressed using pressure
	\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon_1 = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p}}{K} \,p
		\label{eq:th-PE-scalar-p}
	\end{equation}
	
	To obtain a model for calculating this simplified constant $\mathfrak{p}$, another starting point for the problem is utilized. This is the Lorentz-Lorenz relation, which can be used to obtain the following equations for photoelasticity \cite{Korpel1988}
	\begin{align*}
		\Delta n &= C' S \\
		C' &= \left[ \frac{(n^2-1)(n^2+2)}{6n} \right](1-\Lambda_0) \\
		\Lambda_0 &= -\left( \frac{\rho}{\alpha} \right) \frac{\mathrm{d} \alpha}{\mathrm{d} \rho}
	\end{align*}
	where $S$ is the condensation (relative change in density), $\rho$ is the density and $\alpha$ is the molecular polarizability. Here the anisotropic effects are contained in the parameter $\Lambda_0$ \cite{Korpel1988}. If anisotropy should be considered, the tensor model is probably better to use, but if $\Lambda_0$ is neglected a simplified model is obtained. This type of model is usually accurate for liquids, but many solids do not have this behavior \cite{Korpel1988}. Nevertheless, the simplified relation can be written for permittivity (using $\varepsilon_\mrm{r} = n^2$ and $\varepsilon_1 = 2n \Delta n$) as
	\begin{equation*}
		\varepsilon_1 = \frac{1}{3} (\varepsilon_\mrm{r} - 1)(\varepsilon_\mrm{r} + 2) S
	\end{equation*}
	In a fluid model, the condensation can be related to dilatation using the relation $-\rho_\mrm{a}/\rho_0 = \nabla \cdot \bm{u}$ where $\rho_\mrm{a}$ is the change in density \cite{Kaufman2000}. Since the condensation can be written as $S = \rho_\mrm{a}/\rho_0$ \cite{Korpel1988} the relation is rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
		\varepsilon_1 = -\frac{1}{3} (\varepsilon_\mrm{r} - 1)(\varepsilon_\mrm{r} + 2) (\nabla \cdot \bm{u})
	\end{equation*}
	This can be compared with equation \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar} to obtain an equivalent photoelasticity
	\begin{equation}
		\mathfrak{p} = \frac{(\varepsilon_\mrm{r} - 1)(\varepsilon_\mrm{r} + 2)}{3\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2}
		\label{eq:th-PE-liquid-model}
	\end{equation}
	A plot of $\mathfrak{p}$ as a function of $\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$ is shown in figure \ref{fig:photoelastic-liquid}. It can be seen clearly that the interaction strength increases with $\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$ close to 1. However, at around $\varepsilon_\mrm{r} = 4$ an extreme is reached, and further on $\mathfrak{p}$ levels out. Thus, there is a bound on the interaction strength for this relation. It should be noted that this model is extremely simplistic and is probably only accurate for a limited range of materials.

		\caption{\label{fig:photoelastic-liquid} Simplified photoelastic constant $\mathfrak{p}$ as a function of $\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$.}
	\end{figure}
	
	This simple model can be compared with a model for dry air found in the RASS literature. The perturbation in relative permittivity can then be related to pressure as \cite{Rapoport1997}
	\begin{equation*}
		\varepsilon_1 = \frac{1.13 \cdot 10^{-6} p}{T}
	\end{equation*}
	where $p$ is the pressure in Pa and $T$ is the temperature in K (which would give the constant a unit of K/Pa) \todoint{Decide on how to handle units here}. The equations \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar-p} and \eqref{eq:th-PE-liquid-model} can be combined to give the simple model
	\begin{equation*}
		\varepsilon_1 = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p}}{K} \,p = \frac{(\varepsilon_\mrm{r} - 1)(\varepsilon_\mrm{r} + 2)}{3\rho_0 v^2} \,p
	\end{equation*}
	where $K = \rho_0 v^2$ (which holds for fluids) was used \cite{Schmerr2016}. Dry air at 0 $^\circ$C (273 K) has the properties $\rho_0 = 1.293$ kg/m$^3$ and $v = 331.45$ m/s \cite{Onda2003}. In addition, the relative permittivity cannot be approximated to 1 for this case, so the value of $\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \approx 1.00059$ is used \cite{Hector1936}. The simple model presented here can then be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\varepsilon_1 \approx 4.2 \cdot 10^{-9} p
	\end{equation*}
	while the model from \cite{Rapoport1997} at 273 K gives
	\begin{equation*}
		\varepsilon_1 \approx 4.1 \cdot 10^{-9} p
	\end{equation*}
	Thus, the simple model presented here shows good agreement with another model from the literature in air.

	\section{Overview}
	
	\section{Scattering in a perturbed dielectric \label{sec:analytical-scatter}}
	Scattering of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric perturbation is now considered in general. A full derivation can be found in appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter}, and only the main results are shown here. The starting point is Maxwell's equations for a linear, non-magnetic, source-free, isotropic dielectric. Note that the permittivity is not homogeneous.
	\begin{align*}
		&\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{E}} = -\mu_0 \frac{\partial \bm{\mathcal{H}}}{\partial t} \\
		&\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{H}} = \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{\mathcal{E}})}{\partial t} \\
		&\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{\mathcal{E}}) = 0 \\
		&\nabla \cdot \bm{\mathcal{H}} = 0
	\end{align*}
	The script letters are used here to indicate a time dependence as
	\begin{align*}
		&\bm{\mathcal{E}}(\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}(\bm{r},t) \eu^{-\iu\omega t} \\
		&\bm{\mathcal{H}}(\bm{r},t) = \bm{H}(\bm{r},t) \eu^{-\iu\omega t}
	\end{align*}
	A dielectric perturbation is defined as
	\begin{equation*}
	\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0(\varepsilon_\mrm{r} + \varepsilon_1)
	\end{equation*}
	where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$ is the unperturbed value for relative permittivity in the material and $\varepsilon_1$ is a small perturbation around $\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$. 
	
	The electric field is split up into an incident field $\bm{E}_\mrm{i}$ and a scattered field $\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}$ such that $\bm{E} = \bm{E}_\mrm{i} + \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}$. If the scattered field is considered to be small compared to the incident field (Born approximation), Maxwell's equations in this perturbed dielectric can be rewritten as (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter-general}-\ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter-born})
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2\bm{E}_\mrm{sc} + k^2 \bm{E}_\mrm{sc} =	-k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \bm{E}_\mrm{i} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}\nabla(\bm{E}_\mrm{i} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - \frac{2\iu k}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E}_\mrm{i})}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E}_\mrm{i})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $k = \omega/c$ is the wavenumber and $c = 1/\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r}} = c_0/\sqrt{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}$ is the speed of light in the material. The two last terms can be neglected if $v/c \ll |\varepsilon_1|/\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$, (for the speed of sound $v$) and an integral form is written as (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter-born}-\ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter-approx})
	\begin{equation}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \frac{\eu^{\iu k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \left( k^2 \bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r'},t) \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t) + \nabla (\bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r'},t) \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t)) \right) \mathrm{d}v'
		\label{eq:an-scatter-int}
	\end{equation}
	
	\section{Radar equation for simple photoelastic interaction \label{sec:analytical-radar}}
	The scattering integral is now solved for a simple geometry and material model to obtain a radar equation. A full derivation can be found in \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar}, while only the main results are shown here. First, the geometry is defined as shown in figure \ref{fig:an-radar-geom}.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
			\input{fig/scatteringgeom.tikz}
		}
		\caption{\label{fig:an-radar-geom} Geometry for the scattering problem.}
	\end{figure}
	The $xy$-plane is defined as the plane formed by the acoustic and electromagnetic wavevectors (they are assumed to be non-parallel). The scattering volume is a cuboid with dimensions $L_{x}$, $L_{y}$ and $L_{z}$. It is centered in the origin of the coordinate system, and both the acoustic and electromagnetic waves are approximated as plane waves close to the origin. Thus, the electromagnetic and dielectric perturbation fields near the origin are defined as
	\begin{align*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r}',t) &= \bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r}') = \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \eu^{\iu \bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}'} \\
		\varepsilon_1 (\bm{r}',t) &= \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p}}{K} p_0 \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t)
	\end{align*}
	Here, $\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}$ is the complex field amplitude at the origin ($-\iu\omega t$ time-dependence separated) and $\bm{k}$ is the electromagnetic wavevector. The scalar photoelastic relation from equation \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar-p} has been used, where $\mathfrak{p}$ is the photoelastic constant, $p_0$ is the acoustic pressure amplitude at the origin, $K$ is the bulk modulus, $\bm{q}$ is the acoustic wavevector and $\Omega$ the acoustic frequency.
	
	The electromagnetic polarization is assumed to be in z, $\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \parallel \bm{\hat{z}}$. For this problem, equation \eqref{eq:an-scatter-int} is written as (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol})
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) =& \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu kr} \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{8\pi r K} \\
		&\cdot \left( \eu^{-\iu \Omega t} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu ( k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) + \bm{q} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v + \eu^{\iu \Omega t} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu ( k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) - \bm{q} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	Given the geometry in figure \ref{fig:an-radar-geom}, the solution to this integral is written as (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol})
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc} (\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \left( E_\mrm{A}^+ (\bm{r},t) + E_\mrm{A}^- (\bm{r},t) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu kr} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{8\pi r K} L_{x} L_{y} L_{z} e^{\mp \iu \Omega t} \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\Phi^\pm(\theta,\phi) =& \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{x}}{2\pi} \left( k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} \right) \right) \\
		\cdot& \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{y}}{2\pi} \left( -k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} \right) \right) \\
		\cdot& \text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	One important detail to note is that two distinct frequency components arise: one where the frequency is shifted up by $\Omega$ ($E_\mrm{A}^+$) and one where it is shifted down by $\Omega$ ($E_\mrm{A}^-$).
	
	To obtain a more practical expression, the equations are now transformed into power. For this, the time-averaged Poynting vector is calculated as (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-power})
	\begin{equation*}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Re}\left\{ \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r},t) \times \bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^{\pm*} (\bm{r},t) \right\} = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 |E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	where $|E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2$ is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		|E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2 = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{64\pi^2 r^2 K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 L_{z}^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	Using standard antenna parameters, the incident field can be written as (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-power})
	\begin{equation*}
		|\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 = 2\eta_0 \eta \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T}}{4\pi R_\mrm{T}^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\eta_0$ is the wave impedance of free space, $\eta$ is the relative wave impedance in the material, $P_\mrm{T}$ is the power accepted by the antenna, $G_\mrm{T}$ is the maximum gain of the antenna and $R_\mrm{T}$ is the distance from the antenna to the scattering center. This is inserted into the time-average of the power density, giving
	\begin{equation*}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) = \bm{\hat{r}} \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T}}{4\pi R_\mrm{T}^2} \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{64\pi^2 r^2 K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 L_{z}^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	Now the effects of the receiving antenna are considered. It is assumed that this antenna is optimally directed towards the scattering center. The received power can then be written as (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-power})
	\begin{equation*}
		P_\mrm{R}^\pm = \frac{\lambda_\mrm{R}^2 G_\mrm{R}}{4\pi} \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T}}{4\pi R_\mrm{T}^2} \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{64\pi^2 R_\mrm{R}^2 K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 L_{z}^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	where $G_\mrm{R}$ is the gain of the receiving antenna, $\lambda_\mrm{R}$ the wavelength at the antenna (not necessarily the same as in the material) and $R_\mrm{R}$ the distance between the scattering center and the receiver. The receiver is located in the direction $(\theta,\phi)$ as seen from the scattering center. For a more traditional bistatic radar equation \cite{Richards2012} this can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		P_\mrm{R}^\pm = \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{R} \lambda_\mrm{R}^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_\mrm{T}^2 R_\mrm{R}^2}
	\end{equation*}
	with the radar cross-section given by
	\begin{equation*}
		\sigma^\pm (\theta, \phi) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{16\pi K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 L_{z}^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	When actually measuring a signal, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is an important quantity. The equation can be rewritten using SNR (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-SNR}) as:
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathit{SNR}^\pm_N = \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{R} \lambda_\mrm{R}^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_\mrm{T}^2 R_\mrm{R}^2 k_\mrm{B} T_0 B F} N
	\end{equation*}
	where $k_\mrm{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T_0$ is the standard temperature 290 K, $B$ is the receiver bandwidth, $F$ is the noise ratio of the receiver and $N$ is the number of samples recorded. This equation assumes that coherent demodulation and integration is used to boost the SNR.
	
	Inspection of the equations for either scattered power or SNR shows that all angular dependence is contained in the function $\Phi^\pm$. This depends on the observation angles $\theta$, $\phi$ and the angle between EM and Ac. wavevectors $\alpha$. Conditions for the angles maximizing $\Phi^\pm$ are derived in appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-bragg} and summarized as
	\begin{align}
		\theta &= \pi/2 \label{eq:an-bragg-theta} \\
		\cos{\alpha} = \mp \frac{q}{2k} &= \mp \frac{\lambda}{2\Lambda} \label{eq:an-bragg-alpha} \\
		\phi &= \mp \pi + 2\alpha \label{eq:an-bragg-phi}
	\end{align}
	The $\mp$-sign here is related to the $\pm$-sign indicating frequency shift of the scattered wave. These equations correspond directly to the Bragg condition used in acousto-optics (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-bragg}). This gives the model some validation since the acousto-optic Bragg condition is derived from a slightly different starting point, but for the same basic phenomenon \cite{Saleh2007}.
	
	\subsection{Example calculations}
	\todoext{Present example calculations from powerbudget scripts. "Here's how you can cause acousto-electromagnetic interaction using materials found in your own home!"}
	
	\subsection{Refined interaction region} \label{sec:analytical-radar-refined}
	The analytical results presented above are based on a cuboid interaction region. This makes for simple calculations and is fairly straight-forward at a conceptual level. However, it is difficult to find good dimensions $L_x$, $L_y$, $L_z$ based on a real-life system using electromagnetic antennas and ultrasonic transducers. For this reason, the interaction region was refined for simple adaptation to real-life parameters. Other idealizations such as plane waves were still kept. The interaction region was now based on abrupt beams where the fields behave as plane waves inside of the beam diameter and are zero outside. Two crossing beams form a parallelogram as shown in figure \ref{fig:an-parallelogram}.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
			\input{fig/parallelogram.tikz}
		}
		\caption{\label{fig:an-parallelogram} Parallelogram interaction region. Electromagnetic beam diameter $d_\mrm{e}$, acoustic beam diameter $d_\mrm{a}$, angle between wavevectors $\alpha$.}
	\end{figure}
	This new interaction region alters the derivation somewhat in that the scattering integral \eqref{eq:an-scatter-int} is calculated over another region. The resulting scattered field is given by (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-refined})
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_\mrm{sc,p} (\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \left( E_\mrm{A,p}^+ (\bm{r},t) + E_\mrm{A,p}^- (\bm{r},t) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
	E_\mrm{A,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu kr} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{8\pi r K} \frac{d_\mrm{a} d_\mrm{e} L_{z}}{\sin{\alpha}} e^{\mp \iu \Omega t} \Phi_\mrm{p}^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	\Phi_\mrm{p}^\pm =& \text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{2\pi \sin{\alpha}}(k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha}) \right) \\
	&\cdot \text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{e}}{2\pi \tan{\alpha}}
	(k - k\sin{\theta}(\cos{\phi} + \sin{\phi}\tan{\alpha}) \pm q(\cos{\alpha} + \sin{\alpha}\tan{\alpha})) \right) \\
	&\cdot \text{sinc}\left( -\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	This is quite similar to the cuboid result, with the differences being in the interaction volume factor $d_\mrm{a} d_\mrm{e} L_{z}/\sin{\alpha}$ instead of $L_x L_y L_z$ in $E_\mrm{A}$ and the function for angular dependence $\Phi^\pm$. This result is easily transferable to radar equations for power and SNR by using a new radar cross-section, written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\sigma_\mrm{p}^\pm (\theta, \phi) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{16\pi K^2} \frac{d_\mrm{a}^2 d_\mrm{e}^2 L_{z}^2}{\sin^2{\alpha}} \Phi_\mrm{p}^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	It can be shown (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-bragg-refined}) that the same conditions for maximizing $\Phi$ hold for this refined interaction region as for the cuboid interaction region, i.e. equations \eqref{eq:an-bragg-theta}, \eqref{eq:an-bragg-alpha} and \eqref{eq:an-bragg-phi}. One thing to keep in mind though, is that the parallelogram geometry has a factor $1/\sin{\alpha}$ in the interaction region which is not present in the cuboid geometry. The effect of this is that the angle $\alpha$ for maximum scattering can be shifted down in the (-) case and up in the (+) case. The exact shift depends highly on the geometry of the interaction region (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-bragg-refined}).
	
	\subsection{2D solution}
	When comparing analytical results to simulation results it is important to use the same assumptions for both. In the analytical derivations, 3D space has been assumed while simulations are done in 2D. To be able to compare results, a 2D solution to the problem was calculated. Much of the derivations are similar, and only the results are shown here (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-2d} for full derivations). The Poynting vector of the scattered field in 2D can be written as (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-2d})
	\begin{equation}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc,2D}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 |E_\mrm{A,2D}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2
		\label{eq:an-2d-power-cuboid}
	\end{equation}
	where $|E_\mrm{A,2D}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2$ is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		|E_\mrm{A,2D}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2 = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^3 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{8\pi r K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 \Phi_\mrm{2D}^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{equation*}
		\Phi_\mrm{2D}^\pm (\theta,\phi) = \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{x}}{2\pi} ( k - k\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} ) \right) \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{y}}{2\pi} ( - k\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} ) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	As for the 3D solution, the interaction region can be refined using a parallelogram geometry. This leads to the Poynting vector (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-2d})
	\begin{equation}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc,2D,p}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 |E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2
		\label{eq:an-2d-power-parallelogram}
	\end{equation}
	where $|E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2$ is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		|E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2 = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^3 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{8\pi r K^2} \frac{d_\mrm{a}^2 d_\mrm{e}^2}{\sin^2{\alpha}} \Phi_\mrm{2D}^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\Phi_\mrm{2D,p}^\pm (\theta,\phi) = &\text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{2\pi \sin{\alpha}}(k - k\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha}) \right) \\
		\cdot &\text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{e}}{2\pi \tan{\alpha}}
		(k - k(\cos{\phi} + \sin{\phi}\tan{\alpha}) \pm q(\cos{\alpha} + \sin{\alpha}\tan{\alpha})) \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	
	
	\chapter{Numerical Simulation}
	
	\section{Overview}
	The problem was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics for verification and further investigation of more complex scenarios than the one modeled analytically. The two physics interfaces used were the ``Pressure Acoustics, Frequency Domain'' from the basic COMSOL Multiphysics and ``Electromagnetic Waves, Frequency Domain'' from the RF Module. Models were built in 2D for computational speed. One simulation required 1 acoustic and 2 electromagnetic frequency domain simulations to be run, and parameter sweeps would multiply the number required. It was decided that 3D simulations would be too time consuming with little gain when compared with 2D. \todoint{Details on 2D analytical model to compare with (and not 3D)}
	
	The pressure acoustics model was used even though propagation in a solid medium was to be modeled. This was done under an assumption of pure p-wave propagation, which can be modeled using acoustic pressure with a different wave speed as shown in section \ref{sec:th-prop-solid}. However, in these simulations the wave speed was calculated using the acoustic wave speed $v = \sqrt{K/\rho_0}$ which is only correct for p-waves in materials with negligible shear modulus \cite{Schmerr2016}. The reason for this was that wave speed and density entered the COMSOL physics model at multiple places such as the boundary conditions which made it more difficult to determine exactly how to change the wave speed without affecting other parameters. \todoint{Look into this more!}
	
	For all simulations the acoustic frequency was set to 450 MHz, which was used in acoustic frequency domain simulations. From this value and material properties, the acoustic wavelength $\Lambda$ was determined. Using the desired angle $\alpha$ between beams and equation \eqref{eq:an-bragg-alpha}, the electromagnetic wavelength $\lambda$ was calculated. From $\lambda$ and material properties the electromagnetic frequency was calculated, which was used in electromagnetic frequency domain simulations. The electromagnetic frequency was approximately 61.29 GHz, where it was matched to the angles $\alpha = 40^\circ$ (negative frequency shift) or $\alpha = 140^\circ$ (positive frequency shift).
	
	Since frequency domain simulations were used, individual simulation studies could only use one frequency at at time. The acoustic simulation used 450 MHz while the electromagnetic simulations used 61.29 GHz (approximately). One effect of this was that when the relative permittivity change $\varepsilon_1$ was entered in the electromagnetic simulation, it was as a snapshot of the propagating wave. This was due to the very nature of frequency domain simulations where explicit time-dependence is separated from the equations. Without time-dependence, a result showing frequency shifts explicitly was not possible. For these kinds of results, a time-domain simulation with simultaneous calculation of acoustic and electromagnetic fields would be necessary.
	
	\subsection{Geometry and boundary conditions}
	The basic geometry is shown in figure \ref{fig:sim-geometry} for the acoustic and electromagnetic simulations. The only difference in geometry between the two is the Perfectly Matched Layer (PML) which is used in the electromagnetic simulation but not the acoustic simulation. Additionally, the boundary conditions are different for the two simulations which is also shown. One boundary of special interest is the ``Measurement boundary''. This is where the physics domain ends, and the fields were measured at this boundary for post-processing. The radius of the measurement boundary was $30\Lambda$ everywhere except for the apertures which were chords of this circle.
	
	The PML was used to emulate an open boundary at the measurement boundary for the electromagnetic problem. It was a cylindrical type with center in the center of the geometry and a width of $2\lambda$. It used polynomial coordinate stretching with a typical wavelength taken from the electromagnetic physics interface. The PML scaling factor and PML scaling curvature parameter were both set to 1. At the exterior boundary, a Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) boundary condition was used.
	
	The PML function was not available for the basic pressure acoustics interface used here. However, the Cylindrical Wave Radiation boundary condition was available and was used for the same purpose as a PML.

	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Tapering of apertures}
	To reduce sidelobe levels, both the electromagnetic and acoustic apertures had amplitude tapers applied to them. \addref This had the effect of lowering the electric field or acoustic acceleration near the edges of apertures. The specific taper used was a Gaussian taper, which multiplies values at the aperture with a Gaussian function given by
	\begin{equation*}
	\eu^{-(Ay')^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $A$ affects the width of the taper and $y'$ is a coordinate along the aperture with 0 in the center. Since the model was based on a circle and all apertures were modeled as straight lines on the edge of the circle, $y'$ can be found by rotation of the original coordinate $y$ by the angle $\phi$. This transformation is given by \addref
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			x' \\
			y'
		\end{bmatrix}
		=
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} \\
			-\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi}
		\end{bmatrix}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			x \\
			y
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation*}
	which gives the equation for $y'$
	\begin{equation*}
		y' = -x\sin{\phi} + y\cos{\phi}
	\end{equation*}
	The geometry is the same as previously shown in figure \ref{fig:an-radar-geom}. As such, $\phi = \pi$ for EM and $\phi = \pi + \alpha$ for Ac. For the coefficient $A$, it was found that $A = 4/D$ gave a good taper for an aperture width $D$.
	
	\subsection{Modeling of Electromagnetic Aperture}
	An electromagnetic aperture was designed to produce a fairly low beam width while not taking up too much space on the boundary. The model used a ``Port'' boundary condition on a boundary segment with length $D = 8\lambda$. The port options ``User Defined'' and wave excitation were turned on. The port input power was set to 15 dBm. Due to it being located on an interior boundary, the slit condition was activated with a domain-backed slit. For the port mode, the electric field was set as the input quantity with a tapered field in z defined as
	\begin{equation*}
		E_{0z} = e^{-(4y'/D)^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $y'$ is the coordinate $-y$ (since the electromagnetic aperture is fixed at $\phi = \pi$). The propagation constant was set to the wavenumber in the material using ``emw.k''.
	
	\subsection{Modeling of Acoustic Aperture}
	The qualities of beam width and space usage for the electromagnetic aperture were also taken into consideration in the design of the acoustic aperture. The model used a ``Normal Acceleration'' boundary condition on a boundary segment with length $D = 8\Lambda$. The acceleration was set to ``Inward acceleration''. The value of the acceleration amplitude was calculated from a displacement amplitude $u_\mrm{p}$ using $a_0 = \Omega^2 u_\mrm{p}$ \addref. The displacement amplitude was set to 5 nm \todo{Why? Show some reasonable order of magnitude}. The acceleration was tapered as
	\begin{equation*}
		a_\mrm{n} = a_0 \eu^{-(4(x\sin{\alpha} - y\cos{\alpha})/D)^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $x$ and $y$ are coordinates and $\alpha$ the angle between wavevectors.
	
	\subsection{Photoelasticity model}
	To model photoelasticity in COMSOL, equation \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar-p} was used with the photoelastic constant defined by equation \eqref{eq:th-PE-liquid-model}.
	
	\subsection{Material}
	The material model used was based on a foam core. The reason for this was that foam material is fairly homogeneous and isotropic (compared to honeycombs) and is used in aerospace applications \addref. The specific core selected was Divinycell HT251 from Diab Group, which is an aerospace core with applications described as ``Primary structures, radomes, control surfaces and interior components'' \cite{Diab2016}. The relevant material properties were density ($\rho_0$), bulk modulus ($K$) and relative permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$). These were $\rho_0 = 250$ kg/m$^3$, $K = 400$ MPa (nominal) and $\varepsilon_\mrm{r} = 1.29$ \cite{Diab2016}. In COMSOL, the required properties were density, speed of sound, relative permittivity, relative permeability and electric conductivity \todoint{More properties?}. The speed of sound was calculated using $v = \sqrt{K/\rho_0}$ \todoint{reference equation}, the relative permeability was set to 1 and the conductivity to 0. The assumption was that the material was perfectly non-conducting and non-magnetic.
	
	\subsection{Mesh}
	Two meshes were used in simulations: one for the acoustic simulation and one for the electromagnetic simulation. The reason for this was primarily the difference in wavelength.
	
	The acoustic mesh was defined on both the physics domain and PML domain even though only the physics domain was simulated in this case. A free triangular mesh was used with element size between $\Lambda/10$ and $\Lambda/10 \cdot 3 \cdot 10^{-2}$ in the physics domain, and ``Fine'' in the PML domain. Before running the free triangular meshing, the mesh was defined on the measurement boundary.
	
	The electromagnetic mesh used a free triangular mesh in the physics domain and a mapped mesh in the PML domain. The element size in the physics domain was between $\lambda/10$ and $\lambda/10 \cdot 3 \cdot 10^{-2}$. Before running the free triangular meshing, the mesh was defined on the measurement boundary.
	
	\subsection{Simulation studies}
	Before starting simulations, the frequencies, material and geometry were defined. The geometry was in many parts defined as a function of the frequencies and material properties in order to obtain reasonably sized domains and apertures placed according to the Bragg condition.
	
	For the actual simulations, the work flow is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:simulationflow}. First, an acoustic frequency domain study was run using the acoustic frequency and mesh. The result from this was a complex pressure field. Real part convention was used when relating this complex field to the actual pressure.
	
	To transform the pressure to relative permittivity, a variable was used in the material model to define the relative permittivity. This variable took the real part of the pressure field as its input, and used equations \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar} and \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar-p} to calculate a corresponding field for $\varepsilon_1$.
	
	An electromagnetic frequency domain study was now run using the electromagnetic frequency and mesh. The acoustic study was used for calculating initial values for variables not solved for. This was necessary for the pressure field to be available in both studies. Since the photoelastic effect is usually very small, the scattered field was not possible to distinguish with the incident field present. To be able to isolate the scattered field, two simulations were run: one where the relative permittivity of the material was unperturbed and one where it was perturbed by $\varepsilon_1$. The difference between fields resulting from these simulations were identified as the scattered fields.
	
	Due to limitations in the post-processing capabilities of COMSOL, the $E_z$, $H_x$ and $H_y$ fields at the boundary were exported together with $x$ and $y$ coordinates after the electromagnetic simulation was finished. This was done both for the simulation with and without perturbation.
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
			\input{fig/simulationflow.tikz}
		}
		\caption{\label{fig:simulationflow} Simulation flow chart}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Post-processing}
	The simulation results were further processed in SciPy for better visualization of the results than what was possible in COMSOL. The $E_z$, $H_x$ and $H_y$ fields (both with and without photoelastic perturbation) on the domain boundary were exported from COMSOL and loaded in SciPy. The differences between the fields were calculated to obtain the scattered fields. The time-averaged Poynting vector (for scattered fields) was then calculated as
	\begin{align*}
		\left< S_{\mrm{sc},x} \right> &= -\frac{1}{2} \text{Re} \{ E_{\mrm{sc},z} H_{\mrm{sc},y}^* \} \\
		\left< S_{\mrm{sc},y} \right> &= \frac{1}{2} \text{Re} \{ E_{\mrm{sc},z} H_{\mrm{sc},x}^* \}
	\end{align*}
	Due to it being easier to visualize, the magnitude of the time-averaged Poynting vector was also calculated. Using the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, the observation angle $\phi_\mrm{obs}$ for each point was calculated and the data was sorted according to this. A measure for the total scattered power was calculated by integrating the magnitude of the time-averaged Poynting vector over the entire boundary. This was done using the trapezoidal method with the distances between points calculated from the coordinates.
	
	One thing to note is that the definition for radiated power is \todoint{Define this in a good way (2D) and cite something}
	\begin{equation*}
		\int_{C_\mrm{mb}} \left< \bm{S} \right> \cdot \bm{\hat{n}} \, \mrm{d}l
	\end{equation*}
	where $\bm{\hat{n}}$ is the normal to the measurement boundary $C_\mrm{mb}$. However, here the calculation was instead
	\begin{equation*}
		\int_{C_\mrm{mb}} \left| \left< \bm{S} \right> \right|  \, \mrm{d}l
	\end{equation*}
	The reason behind this is that the boundary curvature was large when compared with the beams of interest. This would cause scattered field originating away from the center of the geometry to have less influence on the measure for total scattered power. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:sim-postproc-angles} where the propagation angle, $\phi_\mrm{prop}$, differs from the observation angle normal to the boundary, $\phi_\mrm{obs}$, for much of the scattered field. Using the magnitude of the Poynting vector instead decreases the influence of the boundary geometry.
	
	For plotting of the time-averaged Poynting vector magnitude, the propagation angle $\phi_\mrm{prop}$ was calculated for each data point. The two angles $\phi_\mrm{obs}$ and $\phi_\mrm{prop}$ are shown in figure \ref{fig:sim-postproc-angles} together with the geometry of the problem. From this figure it can be seen that the observation angle depends highly on the measurement point while the propagation angle is a property of the scattered field. For this reason, the propagation angle was chosen for use in plots where the angle mattered.

	\section{Specific Studies}
	This section contains details specific to the different studies run in COMSOL.
		
	\subsection{Comparison with Analytical Model - Angles}
	To compare with the results from section \ref{sec:analytical-radar} the frequencies of the acoustic and electromagnetic waves were matched to a Bragg angle of $40^\circ$ while the angle $\alpha$ between the wavevectors was swept between $\pm 5^\circ$ of the optimal angle. This was done both for (+) and (-) scattering by sweeping around either $\alpha = 40^\circ$ or $\alpha = 140^\circ$, as these angles are the ones given by equation \eqref{eq:an-bragg-alpha} as angles for maximum scattering.
	
	The maximum Poynting vector magnitude was calculated for each $\alpha$ and plotted against this angle. This was done to find the angle $\alpha$ giving maximum scattering. For comparison, the 2D versions of Poynting vector were also plotted for both cuboid and parallelogram geometries using equation \eqref{eq:an-2d-power-cuboid} and \eqref{eq:an-2d-power-parallelogram}. The dimensions were selected such that $d_\mrm{a}$ was the acoustic aperture width, $d_\mrm{e}$ the electrical aperture width and $L_x = d_\mrm{e}$, $L_y = d_\mrm{a}$. These dimensions were selected since they were easy to relate to the model, but had some drawbacks since the interaction regions were not that well reproduced. The equations \eqref{eq:an-2d-power-cuboid} and \eqref{eq:an-2d-power-parallelogram} also require values for $\bm{E}_\mrm{i0}$ and $p_0$. These were selected as the peak field values from the COMSOL simulations. The effect of this was obviously that the analytical comparisons became dependent on some part of the simulations. These peak field values would not be correct amplitudes for use in the equations since the waves in simulations were tapered. Due to this, a correction was used to ensure that the plane waves in analytical solutions would have the same total power as the tapered beams where the peak amplitudes were obtained. \todo{Write more about correction factor}
	
	\subsection{Comparision with Analytical Model - Power}
	To compare the power measure with the analytical calculation, the integral of the Poynting vector magnitude was calculated using equations \eqref{eq:an-2d-power-cuboid} and \eqref{eq:an-2d-power-parallelogram}. The Poynting vectors were calculated the same way as for the angle comparison, and the integrals were calculated numerically using the trapezoid method. The measurement boundary was then approximated by a circle with the radius $30\Lambda$, which was also the value for $r$.
	
	\subsection{Conductive Defect}
	To examine the effect of a defect with electromagnetic contrast but no acoustic contrast, simulations were run with a conductive defect. The geometry of this problem was based on the basic geometry shown in figure \ref{fig:sim-geometry}. The addition was a circle in the center of the physics domain representing a defect. This had the diameter equal to the electromagnetic wavelength $\lambda$. The material in this region was the same as in the physics domain, but with a nonzero electric conductivity.
	
	To demonstrate the effect of conductivity, the electric conductivity of the defect was swept between 0 and 10 S/m in steps of 1 S/m. The angle $\alpha$ was fixed at $40^\circ$ with $\lambda$ matched to $\Lambda$ and this angle.
	
	\subsection{Mechanical Defect}
	To examine the effect of a defect with acoustic contrast but no electromagnetic contrast, simulations were run with a mechanical defect. The mechanical property which was altered was the density since this does not affect the photoelastic relation from equation \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar-p} (for a constant bulk modulus). Since the bulk modulus was kept constant, the acoustic wave speed was changed as the density changed. The geometry of this problem was the same as for the conductive defect simulation. The material inside of the defect region was the same as in the physics domain, but with altered density.
	
	To demonstrate the effect of density change, the density was swept between 100 and 400 kg/m$^3$ in steps of 25 kg/m$^3$. The angle $\alpha$ was fixed at $40^\circ$ with $\lambda$ matched to $\Lambda$ and this angle.

	\subsection{Comparison with Analytical Model - Angle}
	The results from the sweep of the angle between wavevectors $\alpha$ are shown in figures \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak} - \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-polar} for both the (+) and (-) scattering cases. Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak} shows the peak of the scattered Poynting vector magnitude due to photoelasticity for the angles $\alpha = 40^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ together with analytical values. Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-angles} shows the relationship between scattering angle $\phi$ (using the propagation angle $\phi_\mrm{prop}$) and angle between wavevectors $\alpha$. This was plotted using a weighted average of the propagation angle with weights of the Poynting vector corresponding to that angle. This way scattering angles which were not contributing much to the power (such as noise) had their effect on the final value greatly reduced. Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-polar} shows the magnitude of the Poynting vector for different propagation angles $\phi_\mrm{prop}$ as a polar plot. The values are normalized.

		\caption{\label{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak} Peak value of Poynting vector magnitude for different angles between wavevectors $\alpha$. Analytical equivalents plotted for both cuboid and parallelogram geometries.}
	\end{figure}
	Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak} shows that the peak photoelastically scattered Poynting vector magnitude was maximized at an angle $\alpha = 40^\circ$ for (-) scattering (negative frequency shift) and at $\alpha = 140^\circ$ for (+) scattering (positive frequency shift). The analytical comparisons are shown for the cuboid and parallelogram geometries. It can be seen that the peak of the curves is at the same angle $\alpha$ for the simulated values and the cuboid analytical model. Since the wavelengths were selected such that these angles would maximize the scattering (using equation \eqref{eq:an-bragg-alpha}), this would be expected. The parallelogram analytical model has its maximum at another angle $\alpha$, but as discussed in section \ref{sec:analytical-radar-refined} there could be a slight change in this angle $\alpha$. The predicted change was that the angle $\alpha$ of maximum scattering would shift down for (-) scattering and up for (+) scattering, which is what can be seen in figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak}.
	
	What is interesting is that the $\alpha$ shift for the parallelogram geometry is not seen in the simulation results, even though the parallelogram geometry should be more realistic than the cuboid one. This might be due to the length of the $\alpha$ shift being strongly related to interaction region geometry. As described before, the dimensions of the interaction regions were selected using the aperture widths. Since the actual beams diameters were not constant, the dimensions of the interaction region should be slightly larger. Increasing these dimensions slightly lead to the parallelogram curve having its peak closer to the same $\alpha$ as simulations. If the simulation curve is observed, a slight asymmetry can be seen around the $\alpha$ for the peak (easier to see for (-) than for (+)). This might be indication of a very slight shift in $\alpha$ compared with 40$^\circ$/140$^\circ$, but difficult to exactly replicate analytically with the geometry parameters available in the parallelogram model.
	
	While the angle $\alpha$ of the peak in figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak} shows fair correspondence between analytical and simulated cases, the magnitude of the Poynting vector is quite different. Neither of the analytical geometries lead to a correct shape of the curve or correct value for $\left| \left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc} \right> \right|_\mrm{max}$ when compared to the simulation. The reason behind this might be the interaction region not being the correct size. Neither the cuboid or parallelogram geometry takes into account the spreading nature of the simulated beams which affects the interaction region. For better correspondence, the dimensions of the interaction region might be estimated from the COMSOL simulations. However, requiring more data from simulations is not a strength of the analytical model.
	
	Another reason for the difference in the shape of the curves in figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak} might be that the analytical model is based entirely on plane waves. This means that a suboptimal angle $\alpha$ should not lead to much interaction. The simulation, on the other hand, uses more realistic wave propagation with cylindrical waves. A cylindrical wave can be decomposed into a sum of plane waves with different propagation direction. This essentially means that the condition in equation \eqref{eq:an-bragg-alpha} is satisfied for every angle $\alpha$ for some combination of plane wave components. However, the plane wave components have different amplitudes and the strongest components are the ones with the same propagation direction as the original beams. This causes the Poynting vector magnitude to be smaller for suboptimal $\alpha$, but still larger than if there had been no Bragg matched components at all.
	
	Nevertheless, the peaks for simulation, cuboid and parallelogram cases in figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak} are at angles $\alpha$ fairly close to each other and all values for $\left| \left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc} \right> \right|_\mrm{max}$ are in the same order of magnitude. This is the case even though geometric parameters used in the analytical models could have been selected with more care. \todo{Maybe more?}

	\end{figure}
	Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-angles} shows a linear relationship between the angle $\alpha$ between incident wavevectors and the propagation angle $\phi_\mrm{prop}$. This can be compared with the analytical result in equation \eqref{eq:an-bragg-phi}, which gives a relationship valid at the point of maximum scattering. The propagation angles at $\alpha = 40^\circ$ and $\alpha = 140^\circ$ from the plot (the angles which maximized scattering) are $\phi_\mrm{prop} = 260^\circ$ and $\phi_\mrm{prop} = 100^\circ$ respectively. This is in agreement with the analytical values from equation \eqref{eq:an-bragg-phi}. Further from these angles $\alpha$, the analytical equation is no longer valid (since this is not at the point of maximum scattering). However, as discussed before the simulated beams can be decomposed as a sum of plane waves. This means that equation \eqref{eq:an-bragg-phi} is valid for some pair of plane wave components at every angle $\alpha$.
	\todoext{This could be looked into more. Might be interesting to explore how the slope of the graphs is related to the combinations of EM and Ac. plane wave components.}

	Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-polar} shows the angular behavior of the Poynting vector magnitude in a simple way. What is clear is that the scattering is quite directive - the Poynting vector magnitude drops sharply for propagation angles deviating from that of the peak value.
	
	\subsection{Comparison with Analytical Model - Power}
	This part describes the results for total scattered power. Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-power} shows the total scattered power due to photoelasticity for the angles $\alpha = 40^\circ \pm 5^\circ$ together with analytical values.
	\begin{figure}[H]

		\caption{\label{fig:res-angle-sweep-power-c} Poynting vector magnitude integrated over measurement boundary for different angles between wavevectors $\alpha$. Analytical equivalents plotted for both cuboid and parallelogram geometries.}
	\end{figure}
	Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-power-c} shows that the peak photoelastically scattered power was maximized at an angle $\alpha = 40^\circ$ for (-) scattering (negative frequency shift) and at $\alpha = 140^\circ$ for (+) scattering (positive frequency shift). This shows that the angle $\alpha$ which maximizes the peak value of the Poynting vector magnitude also maximizes the total photoelastically scattered power. The analytical cases have their peaks close to these as well, but there is a shift in the angle $\alpha$ for the parallelogram curve. This shift is down in $\alpha$ for the (-) case and up for the (+) case, so it directly follows the shift observed in figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-peak} and explained in section \ref{sec:analytical-radar-refined}.
	
	The peaks of the total scattering power for simulation, cuboid and parallelogram cases are within 2 dB of each other, so in the same order of magnitude. As explained before, the geometry parameters in the analytical models could be selected with more care which might improve analytical results. One clear difference between simulated and analytical curves is that the analytical ones drop much faster than the simulated when moving away from the peak. This can be explained by the difference between plane and cylindrical waves. As explained earlier, cylindrical waves can be decomposed as a sum of plane waves with different propagation directions giving pairs of matched plane wave components at more than one angle $\alpha$. The higher scattering power away from the peak in the simulated case could then simply be due to scattering of these other pairs of matched components.

	%\todoint[inline]{Issues due to the analytical model having an assumption on plane waves. This is not actually valid since the "target" is an overlap between two beams. This overlap is necessarily defined by the beam profiles, and an assumption of plane waves with an otherwise correct interaction region will automatically assume a constant amplitude beam profile. This will lead to much higher scattering than with actual beam profiles since plane waves have "more amplitude" for both EM and Ac. waves in the interaction region. One way to alleviate the issue would be to instead use some sort of "equivalent amplitude", i.e. use plane wave amplitude values which will cause the total field energy to be equal to that of the cylindrical wave (inside the same interaction region). This might require some thinking to get correct, but I think it should work (at least better than the original one).}
	
	Figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-power} shows the same simulation results as in figure \ref{fig:res-angle-sweep-power-c}, but without the analytical results. This makes it easier to compare (+) and (-) scattering.	It can be seen that the (+) scattering results in a higher total scattered power than (-) scattering. This can be explained by the interaction region being larger for (+) than it is for (-) scattering. It holds that (-) scattering happens at angles $0 < \alpha < \pi/2$ and (+) scattering for $\pi/2 < \alpha < \pi$ (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-bragg}). For the beams used in this particular simulation, the (-) scattering geometry leads to a region near the apertures where there is no overlap between acoustic and electromagnetic beams. On the other hand, in the (+) scattering geometry there is always some overlap between the beams as the apertures are at two different sides of the domain. \todo{Insert comsol images to better explain this}. The total scattered power is directly proportional to the square of the interaction region in the simple model from section \ref{sec:analytical-radar} \todo{reference equation}, so from these observations it is reasonable that the (+) scattering leads to higher power levels.
	
	If the absolute power levels are considered, they are between -82.6 and -82.7 dBm \todo{Change after using normal component instead of magnitude for Poynting vector integral} for both the (+) and (-) cases. This can be compared with the input power of 15 dBm, which means that the photoelastically scattered power is 97 dB lower than the input electromagnetic power in these simulations. \todo{continue}
	
	\subsection{Conductive Defect}
	The results from the sweep of defect conductivity is shown in figure \ref{fig:res-cond-power}. This shows the total scattered power (calculated in the same way as in the angle sweep) as a function of conductivity of the defect. It can be seen that the scattered power decreases as the conductivity of the defect increases. The relation between conductivity and scattered power looks approximately inversely exponential as the decrease in power is strongest at small conductivities and plateaus at higher levels.
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
			\input{fig/cond-power.pgf}
		}
		\caption{\label{fig:res-cond-power} Poynting vector magnitude integrated over measurement boundary for different conductivity $\sigma$ of defect. Normalized by maximum value.}
	\end{figure}
	
	The reasons behind the decrease in scattered power can be explained by looking at the electric field for different defect conductivities \todo{figures from comsol?}. The field is affected by conductivity in two ways: first, the field is pushed out of the defect as conductivity increases. Second, the field is also scattered against the defect which causes the electromagnetic beam to drastically change in appearance when compared to a defect-free case. One crucial effect is the altered propagation directions of the beam after the defect. This directly influences the Bragg condition, and then also the photoelastic scattering.
	
	As figure \ref{fig:res-cond-power} shows, there is a plateauing effect in that the decrease in power is not as large at high conductivities as it is at lower conductivities. This can be explained by the electric field being pushed out of the defect region. As the field is pushed out, the defect behaves increasingly as a PEC sphere. As such, the total scattering power also approaches the level obtained when the defect is a PEC sphere, and cannot decrease any further than this. \todo{Simulate using a PEC sphere to show this point}
	
	\todoext{Discuss how the conductivity is not included in the permittivity in a good way here (COMSOL does it internally). For a better model, the conductivity should also go into the photoelastic model in the form of an imaginary relative permittivity. However, it is not clear if the photoelastic model even supports this (it is very simple). Better PE model probably necessary. In addition, the interaction is basically destroyed just due to the behavior of the electric field. A slight change in the photoelastic properties would probably not cause any significant change to the observed effect.}

	\subsection{Mechanical Defect}
	The results of the sweep of defect density is shown in figure \ref{fig:res-mech-power}. This shows the total scattered power (calculated in the same way as in the angle sweep) as a function of density of the defect. For reference, the rest of the domain had the density $\rho_0 = 250$ kg/m$^3$. It can be seen that the scattered power is affected by a change in density in the defect area. At defect densities far away from the background density 250 kg/m$^3$ the effect is a decrease in scattered power.
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{

		}
		\caption{\label{fig:res-mech-power} Poynting vector magnitude integrated over measurement boundary for different density $\rho_0$ of defect. Normalized by maximum value.}
	\end{figure}
	
	One interesting detail is that the maximum of the scattered power is not obtained at a defect density of 250 kg/m$^3$, but instead slightly higher at 275 kg/m$^3$. This can be understood by observing the pressure field from COMSOL \todo{Add COMSOL figures?}. At a defect density slightly above the background density the acoustic beam is focused into a more plane wave than before. This can be understood by viewing the defect as an acoustic lens. In geometrical optics, a lens is typically a region with higher refractive index than its surroundings bounded by spherical surfaces \cite{Saleh2007}. A higher refractive index in optics corresponds to a lower wave speed. In acoustics, the wave speed is defined as $v = \sqrt{K/\rho_0}$, so an increase in density also has the effect of lowering wave speed. The properties of the circular defect with a higher density than the background should then give it some lens properties. A significant difference between typical lenses and the case here is that the lens size is usually much larger than the wavelength, while they are in the same order of magnitude here. This case is very far from geometrical optics, and the physics required to explain focusing is vastly different \cite{Fletcher2001}.
	
	The lensing effect increases the scattered power for a small increase in defect density as the beam spread is counteracted. However, for even higher defect densities other effects instead cause a decrease in scattered power. A diffraction pattern appears behind the defect where regions of the wave with different propagation direction are separated by nodal lines \todo{COMSOL images?}.
	
	One thing to note is that the increase in scattered power from this lensing phenomenon is not very large as the power at background density is at more than 95\% of the peak power. Additionally, this effect is highly dependent on geometry as the circular shape of the defect causes the increase in power. This effect should not be expected from an arbitrarily shaped defect. \todo{Explain more on arbitrary defects?}

	\section{Possibilities for NDT}
	From the simulations with defects it was clear that defects with both electric and acoustic contrast had an effect on the photoelastic scattering. This indicates that an acousto-electromagnetic system utilizing photoelastic interaction at least has the ability to detect the presence of defects with either of those properties. This ability alone does not tell much about the possible performance of a future system. A good guideline is that an NDT system using both acoustic and electromagnetic waves (e.g. ultrasound and mm-waves) should be at least as good as a system using only one of the phenomena. An acousto-electromagnetic system would probably be more complicated and expensive than an ultrasonic testing or a mm-wave imaging system, so in order to be useful it would have to offer better performance using some metric.
	
	One possible way an acousto-electromagnetic system might outperform acoustic or electromagnetic systems is due to its ability to detect both electric and acoustic contrast. Directly, it allows for detection of more types of defects than existing systems by themselves. However, the possibility of different types of contrast leading to combined effects might be even more promising. The main mechanism allowing detection using photoelastic interaction was determined to be defects disrupting the incident beams, in turn leading to less advantageous conditions for the interaction. If a defect has both electric and acoustic contrast, the effect would be disruption of both the electromagnetic and acoustic beams. This should lead to a larger effect on the photoelastically scattered field than for just one mode of contrast. Due to this combination effect, it might be possible to detect a region with weak acoustic and electric contrasts with the same performance as a strong single contrast. If this is possible for acoustic and electric contrasts which are weak enough, an acousto-electromagnetic system might outperform a system using only one phenomenon for this type of defects. However, the photoelastic scattering against a combination of contrasts was not simulated in this work.
	
	A possible issue with photoelastic interaction in NDT is related to resolution. One crucial factor affecting the interaction strength is the size of the interaction region. To obtain a high photoelastically scattered power, this region should be as large as possible. On the other hand, the possible resolution of the system should decrease with large interaction regions. \todo{Might be ways to use very large interaction regions but still have resolution. A defect inside of the interaction region would only affect scattering after the defect. There should therefore be a dip in received power after the defect when looking from the start to the end of the scattered beam. Difficult to describe though, and this is also only a hypothesis}
	
	\section{Future Work}	
	One issue which became apparent in comparisons between the analytical and simulated results was the assumption of plane waves in the analytical models. This was discussed as being a possible reason for discrepancies between simulated and analytical values in multiple cases. One idea for refining the analytical models is to utilize the fact that all waves can be decomposed into a sum of plane waves with varying propagation directions. More specifically, an arbitrary wave is related to plane wave amplitudes with specific propagation directions by a spatial Fourier transform \todo{Or is it the inverse transform here? Maybe write the equations}. With knowledge of the field distribution at an aperture, the plane wave components can be calculated \cite{Orfanidis2016}. The way this could be used for the analytical problem is by first defining field distributions at the electromagnetic and acoustic apertures and calculating plane wave components. All possible combinations of acoustic and electromagnetic components can then be input to the original model since they are all plane waves. The results of all combinations should then be transformed back to obtain a Poynting vector for the scattered field. Clearly, more work is required since the method is merely at a concept level at this stage. However, this might be a way to obtain more accurate results, though numeric calculations would probably be necessary due to the large number of combinations (using tools such as fft).
	
	More refined simulations would be interesting for future work. There are many possibilities in this region since the simulations in this work were very basic. The sources for acoustic and electromagnetic waves were very basic apertures, which could be improved. Modeling of a realistic antenna and ultrasonic transducer would require more complicated modeling and more computational resources, but might give more information on realistic performance. One interesting possibility related to this is the modeling of interfaces between the sources and test object. For the electromagnetic waves, some minor reflection might be caused by an air-test object boundary. For the acoustic waves on the other hand, the coupling of ultrasonic waves into the core material is often done using a fluid couplant between the transducer and test object, which would then be modeled \cite{Schmerr2016}. Better investigation of ultrasonic wave propagation would also require modeling of elastic waves instead of fluid acoustics. To implement the acoustic refinement ideas in COMSOL the easiest way would be to use the ''Acoustics Module`` and ''Structural Mechanics Module``, but it is possible to enter the required equations and boundary conditions manually with only the basic COMSOL distribution.
	
	To understand possibilities and limitations for use in NDT, more realistic defects need to be modeled as well as better geometries. \todo{Write more here}
	
	Aerospace composites are comprised of a core material laminated by reinforcing material \addref. In this work, acousto-electromagnetic interaction was modeled only for a homogeneous material, which was based on an aerospace composite core in simulations. The effect of a different material at the edges of the core were not considered, which might instead be an interesting topic for future work. Abrupt changes in material as at the core-reinforcement boundary might cause reflections for either the acoustic or electromagnetic wave. Additionally, if the thickness of the composite is on the same order of magnitude as the wavelengths reflections might become even more complicated. Another related topic is that of honeycomb cores. These were not used in simulations due to their anisotropy, and a foam core material was used instead. However, honeycombs are used frequently in aerospace composites so possible effects of their anisotropy would be interesting to investigate further.
	
	\subsection{Experiments}
	\todoext{Experiments - simple verification of the photoelastic interaction mechanism at the specific combination of ultrasound/microwave or ultrasound/mm-wave frequencies. Primarily, the Bragg condition would be the most interesting thing to verify. Both the angle and frequency requirements and shifts are interesting.}
	The next logical step after analytical modeling and numerical simulations is experimental testing to compare with the analytical and numerical results. Two important interaction properties to measure are the Bragg condition for incident/scattering angles (equations \eqref{eq:an-bragg-theta}, \eqref{eq:an-bragg-phi} and \eqref{eq:an-bragg-alpha}) and the frequency shift of scattered waves. The other important property to measure would be the received scattering power. However, measurement of the Bragg condition and frequency shift should be more robust to variation in the test environment than the received power. Bragg condition and frequency shift measurements  could then be important for verifying the analytical and/or simulation results. Specific measurement values for received power might be useful for understanding the order of magnitude of the interaction strength. However, comparison of received power at different angles, frequencies etc. should be more interesting when comparing experiments with analytical and simulation results.
	
	Some parts in the analytical models and numerical simulations can be identified at this stage to be less certain than others. One in particular, the photoelastic model is important to test experimentally since the model itself could not be verified in COMSOL. The coupling between acoustic pressure and relative permittivity was done entirely using equations \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar-p} and \eqref{eq:th-PE-liquid-model}, which were admittedly very simplified when compared to the full tensor model. Thorough experimentation would give more insight to how accurate the simple model used here really is, and where its main drawbacks might lie. Some points worth looking into are the assumption of isotropy in the photoelastic tensor, the assumption of $p_{11} = p_{12}$ in the isotropic photoelastic tensor and the model for the photoelastic constant in equation \eqref{eq:th-PE-liquid-model}. All of these have connections to each other, so experiments should be designed with this in mind.
	
	A part which might be lacking in the analytical models and numerical simulations is that of ultrasonic wave propagation. Most of the analytical modeling was based on pure p-wave propagation, which might not be the case in reality. If also a more complicated photoelastic model is reuired, using a photoelastic tensor instead of the simplified photoelastic constant in equation \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar-p}, s-waves would affect the interaction in a way not modeled analytically. Numerical simulations were even more simplistic when it came to ultrasonic wave propagation, assuming a negligible shear modulus. The result of this is that the wave speed equation is equal to that in fluid acoustics, which was used to model phenomena in the COMSOL "pressure acoustics" interface. However, for a non-negligible shear modulus the true p-wave speed is higher than that given by fluid acoustics. \todoext{Refer to equations or write them directly. This part should probably be moved to another part of the discussion since it is interesting for more than just future work (although it should be mentioned here as well)}

	\section{Derivation of scattering integral for perturbed dielectrics \label{sec:app-derivations-scatter}}
	Here follows a formal derivation of the scattering of electromagnetic waves against a perturbation in relative permittivity. This is useful in photoelastic interaction since an acoustic wave in that case causes a periodic dielectric perturbation. Most of this derivation is based on a similar derivation by Tatarskii which considers scattering from turbulence in air \cite{Tatarskii1971}.
	
	\subsection{General equation for electric field in perturbated dielectric \label{sec:app-derivations-scatter-general}}
	First, Maxwell's equations for a linear, non-magnetic, source-free, isotropic dielectric are presented. Note that the permittivity is not homogeneous.
	\begin{align*}
		&\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{E}} = -\mu_0 \frac{\partial \bm{\mathcal{H}}}{\partial t} \\
		&\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{H}} = \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{\mathcal{E}})}{\partial t} \\
		&\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{\mathcal{E}}) = 0 \\
		&\nabla \cdot \bm{\mathcal{H}} = 0
	\end{align*}
	The script letters are used here to indicate a time dependence as
	\begin{align*}
		&\bm{\mathcal{E}}(\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}(\bm{r},t) \eu^{-\iu\omega t} \\
		&\bm{\mathcal{H}}(\bm{r},t) = \bm{H}(\bm{r},t) \eu^{-\iu\omega t}
	\end{align*}
	This is used to remove the e$^{-i\omega t}$ dependence in the equations and only keep ``slower'' time dependencies. The new equations are
	\begin{align}
		&\nabla \times \bm{E} = \iu\omega \mu_0 \bm{H} - \mu_0 \frac{\partial \bm{H}}{\partial t} \label{eq:app-scatter-faraday} \\
		&\nabla \times \bm{H} = -\iu\omega \varepsilon \bm{E} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} \label{eq:app-scatter-ampere} \\
		&\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{E}) = 0 \label{eq:app-scatter-gauss} \\
		&\nabla \cdot \bm{H} = 0 \label{eq:app-scatter-magn}
	\end{align}
	Now $\nabla \times$ is applied to $\nabla \times \bm{E}$ and it is combined with $\nabla \times \bm{H}$, giving
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla \times (\nabla \times \bm{E}) = \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} + 2\iu \omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	The relation $\nabla \times (\nabla \times \bm{E}) = -\nabla^2\bm{E} + \nabla(\nabla \cdot \bm{E})$ is now used
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \bm{E}) - 2\iu \omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
		\label{eq:app-scatter-Efield1}
	\end{equation}
	Gauss' law \eqref{eq:app-scatter-gauss} is now expanded to $\varepsilon(\nabla \cdot \bm{E}) + (\nabla \varepsilon) \cdot \bm{E} = 0$. This can be rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla \cdot \bm{E} = -\bm{E} \cdot \frac{\nabla \varepsilon}{\varepsilon} = -\bm{E} \cdot \nabla (\ln{\varepsilon})
	\end{equation*}
	Inserting this into equation \eqref{eq:app-scatter-Efield1} gives
	\begin{equation}
		\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} = -\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla (\ln{\varepsilon})) - 2\iu \omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
		\label{eq:app-scatter-Efield2}
	\end{equation}
	Now, the dielectric perturbation is defined as
	\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0(\varepsilon_\mrm{r} + \varepsilon_1)
		\label{eq:app-scatter-eps}
	\end{equation}
	where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$ is the unperturbed value for relative permittivity in the material and $\varepsilon_1$ is a small perturbation around $\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$. For $|\varepsilon_1| \ll \varepsilon_\mrm{r}$ $\ln{\varepsilon}$ can be approximated as
	\begin{equation*}
		\ln{\varepsilon} = \ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r}) + \ln(1 + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}) \approx \ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r}) + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}
	\end{equation*}
	Since $\ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r})$ is constant, the gradient can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla(\ln{\varepsilon}) = \nabla \left( \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \right) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \nabla \varepsilon_1
	\end{equation*}
	This is now inserted in equation \eqref{eq:app-scatter-Efield2} together with equation \eqref{eq:app-scatter-eps}, giving
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r} \bm{E} = \\
		-\omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_1 \bm{E} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - 2\iu \omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Now $k$ is defined as $k = \omega/c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in the material
	\begin{equation*}
		c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r}}} = \frac{c_0}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}}
	\end{equation*}
	This is now used to obtain
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2\bm{E} + k^2 \bm{E} = \\
		-k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \bm{E} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - \frac{2\iu k}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Born approximation and solution \label{sec:app-derivations-scatter-born}}
	Now the electric field is split up into an incident field $\bm{E}_\mrm{i}$ and a scattered field $\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}$ such that $\bm{E} = \bm{E}_\mrm{i} + \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}$. The scattered field is considered to be small compared to the incident field (Born approximation). The incident field then approximately obeys the source-free equation
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2 \bm{E}_\mrm{i} + k^2 \bm{E}_\mrm{i} = 0
	\end{equation*}
	If this is subtracted from the total equation and $\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}$ is neglected in the RHS the resulting equation is
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2\bm{E}_\mrm{sc} + k^2 \bm{E}_\mrm{sc} =	-k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \bm{E}_\mrm{i} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}\nabla(\bm{E}_\mrm{i} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - \frac{2\iu k}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E}_\mrm{i})}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E}_\mrm{i})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	This is an inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation which in three dimensions, and under a Sommerfeld radiation condition has the solution \addref
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) =& \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \frac{\eu^{\iu k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{4\pi |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \\
		&\cdot \left( -k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \bm{E}_\mrm{i} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}\nabla(\bm{E}_\mrm{i} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1)- \frac{2\iu k}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E}_\mrm{i})}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E}_\mrm{i})}{\partial t^2} \right) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Approximation of the integral \label{sec:app-derivations-scatter-approx}}
	To simplify this equation even more, approximations concerning the nature of the perturbation can be done. The dielectric perturbation is thus assumed to have the following behavior:
	\begin{equation*}
		\varepsilon_1 (\bm{r},t) = |\varepsilon_1| \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r} - \Omega t)
	\end{equation*}
	where $|\varepsilon_1|$ is the amplitude, $\bm{q}$ is the acoustic wavevector and $\Omega$ is the acoustic angular frequency. Furthermore, the relations between wavenumbers and wavelengths are introduced as $k = 2\pi/\lambda$ for electromagnetics and $q = |\bm{q}| = 2\pi/\Lambda$ for acoustics.
	
	Now the terms inside of the parenthesis in the integral are estimated to see which terms are dominant. The terms are denoted $T_n$ where $n$ begins at 1 and is the order in which they appear. Note that these estimations are only to find orders of magnitude. For the first term:
	\begin{equation*}
		T_1 \sim \frac{|\varepsilon_1| |\bm{E}|}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \lambda^2}
	\end{equation*}
	For term 2 $\nabla \varepsilon_1 \sim \Lambda^{-1} |\varepsilon_1| \bm{v}$ where $\bm{v}$ is a vector with components $\sim \sin(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r} - \Omega t)$. Then $\nabla (\bm{E} \cdot \bm{v}) \sim \nabla(|\bm{E}| \sin(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r} - \Omega t)) \sim \nabla(|\bm{E}|) + \nabla(\sin(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r} - \Omega t)) \sim \lambda^{-1} + \Lambda^{-1}$. The resulting estimation of the term is then
	\begin{equation*}
		T_2 \sim \frac{|\varepsilon_1| |\bm{E}|}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \Lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Term 3 can be expanded using the perturbation definition and the chain rule:
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		T_3 \sim \frac{k}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} &= \frac{k}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \left( \varepsilon_0\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \varepsilon_0\varepsilon_1 \frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \varepsilon_0\bm{E} \frac{\partial \varepsilon_1}{\partial t}\right) \\
		&\sim \frac{1}{c\lambda} \left( \frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \frac{\bm{E}}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \frac{\partial \varepsilon_1}{\partial t} \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	The derivatives can be approximated as
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial \varepsilon_1}{\partial t} &\sim |\varepsilon_1|\Omega \sim \frac{|\varepsilon_1| v}{\Lambda} \\
		\frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} &\sim \bm{E} v \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
	\end{align*}
	where $v$ is the speed of sound in the material. The second equation comes from a similar equation in \cite{Tatarskii1971} which takes into account the Doppler effect and changes in $\varepsilon_1$. These are inserted to give
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		T_3 &\sim \frac{1}{c\lambda} \left( |\bm{E}| v \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{|\varepsilon_1|}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \right) + \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \Lambda} \right) \\
		&= \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{c\lambda} \left( \left( 1 + \frac{|\varepsilon_1|}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right) + \frac{|\varepsilon_1|}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \Lambda} \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	Now, the condition $|\varepsilon_1| \ll \varepsilon_\mrm{r}$, or equivalently, $|\varepsilon_1|/\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \ll 1$ is used to write the the term as
	\begin{equation*}
		T_3 \sim \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{c\lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Term 3 can now be compared with term 1 and 2 to determine the relative sizes.
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{T_3}{T_1} &= \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{c\lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
		\bigg/
		\frac{|\varepsilon_1| |\bm{E}|}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \lambda^2} =
		\frac{v}{c} \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}{|\varepsilon_1|} \left( 1 + \frac{\lambda}{\Lambda} \right) \\
		\frac{T_3}{T_2} &= \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{c\lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
		\bigg/
		\frac{|\varepsilon_1| |\bm{E}|}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r} \Lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right) =
		\frac{v}{c} \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}{|\varepsilon_1|} \frac{\Lambda}{\lambda}
	\end{align*}
	Inspection of these fractions reveals that the condition required for $T_3$ to be neglected is
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{v}{c} \ll \frac{|\varepsilon_1|}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}
	\end{equation*}
	This holds for any ratio between $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$. If $\lambda \gg \Lambda$, $T_2$ will dominate $T_3$. If $\Lambda \gg \lambda$, $T_1$ will dominate $T_3$. If $\lambda \sim \Lambda$, both $T_1$ and $T_2$ will dominate $T_3$. The fourth term on the RHS is similar to the third, but contains a factor $(v/c)^2$. Thus, if $T_3$ can be neglected, so can $T_4$.	The simplified equation if the condition $v/c \ll |\varepsilon_1|/\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$ holds is shown below:
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \frac{\eu^{\iu k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \left( k^2 \bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r'},t) \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t) + \nabla (\bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r'},t) \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t)) \right) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{equation*}
	
	\section{Derivation of radar equation for simple photoelasticity \label{sec:app-derivations-radar}}
	The scattering integral derived in appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter-approx} is now solved for a simple geometry and material model to obtain a radar equation.
	
	\subsection{Geometry and solution of scattering integral \label{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol}}
	First, the geometry is defined as shown in figure \ref{fig:app-radar-geom}.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
			\input{fig/scatteringgeom.tikz}
		}
		\caption{\label{fig:app-radar-geom} Geometry for the scattering problem.}
	\end{figure}
	The $xy$-plane is defined as the plane formed by the acoustic and electromagnetic wavevectors (they are assumed to be non-parallel). The scattering volume is centered in the origin of the coordinate system, and both the acoustic and electromagnetic waves are approximated as plane waves close to the origin. Thus, the electromagnetic and dielectric perturbation fields near the origin are defined as
	\begin{align}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r}',t) &= \bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r}') = \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \eu^{\iu \bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}'} \label{eq:app-radar-planeE} \\
		\varepsilon_1 (\bm{r}',t) &= \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p}}{K} p_0 \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t) \label{eq:app-radar-planeEps}
	\end{align}
	Here, $\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}$ is the complex field amplitude at the origin ($-\iu\omega t$ time-dependence separated) and $\bm{k}$ is the electromagnetic wavevector. The scalar photoelastic relation from equation \eqref{eq:th-PE-scalar-p} has been used, where $\mathfrak{p}$ is the photoelastic constant, $p_0$ is the acoustic pressure amplitude at the origin, $K$ is the bulk modulus, $\bm{q}$ is the acoustic wavevector and $\Omega$ the acoustic frequency.
	
	For simplicity, the electromagnetic polarization is assumed to be in z, $\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \parallel \bm{\hat{z}}$. This is also in part done to avoid polarization changes in the scattered field \cite{Korpel1988}. Due to this $\nabla(\bm{E}_\mrm{i} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) = \bm{0}$ which simplifies the scattering integral to
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{k^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \frac{\eu^{\iu k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r'},t) \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{equation*}
	Insertion of equation \eqref{eq:app-radar-planeE} and \eqref{eq:app-radar-planeEps} gives
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{k^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \frac{\eu^{\iu k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \eu^{\iu \bm{k} \cdot \bm{r}'} \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p}}{K} p_0 \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{equation*}
	Assuming far-field gives an approximation for the Green-function as \cite{Kristensson2008}
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{\eu^{\iu k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \approx \frac{\eu^{\iu kr}}{r} \eu^{-\iu k \bm{\hat{r}} \cdot \bm{r}'}
	\end{equation*}
	where $r = |\bm{r}|$ and $\bm{\hat{r}} = \bm{r}/r$. The scattering integral is now written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu kr} \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{4\pi r K} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu k ( \bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{equation*}
	The cosine is now written as complex exponentials giving
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
			\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) =& \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu kr} \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{8\pi r K} \\
			&\cdot \left( \eu^{-\iu \Omega t} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu ( k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) + \bm{q} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v + \eu^{\iu \Omega t} \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu ( k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) - \bm{q} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	The two integrals are of the same form, $\int \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v'$, where $\bm{A}$ is independent of $\bm{r}'$. This is solved in general below for the cuboid volume defined by $-L_m/2 \leq m \leq L_m/2$, $m = x,y,z$.
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' &=
		\int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} x'} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{y}} y'} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{z}} z'} \mathrm{d}v' \\
		&= \prod_{m = x,y,z} \frac{1}{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}}} \left( \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}} L_m/2} - \eu^{-\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}} L_m/2} \right) \\
		&= \prod_{m = x,y,z} \frac{2}{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}}} \sin \left(\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}} \frac{L_m}{2} \right) 
		= \prod_{m = x,y,z} L_m \text{sinc} \left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}} L_m}{2\pi} \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	where sinc$(x) = \sin(\pi x)/(\pi x)$. To apply this result to $\bm{A} = k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) \pm \bm{q}$ this is first simplified using the geometry defined earlier.
	\begin{equation*}
		k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) \pm \bm{q} = k\bm{\hat{x}} - k(\bm{\hat{x}} x + \bm{\hat{y}} y + \bm{\hat{z}} z)/r \pm q(\bm{\hat{x}} \cos{\alpha} + \bm{\hat{y}} \sin{\alpha})
	\end{equation*}
	where r is not written out fully. $\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}}$ are now calculated for the three coordinate axes as
	\begin{equation} 
	\begin{split}
		\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} &= k - kx/r \pm q\cos{\alpha} = k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} \\
		\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{y}} &= - ky/r \pm q\sin{\alpha} = - k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} \\
		\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{z}} &= -kz/r = -k\cos{\theta}
	\end{split}
	\label{eq:radar-Aproj}
	\end{equation}
	where a conversion to spherical coordinates was made. Insertion into the integral solution gives:
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split} 
			\int_{V_\mrm{sc}} &\eu^{\iu (	k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) \pm \bm{q}) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' \\
			=& L_{x} \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{x}}{2\pi} ( k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} ) \right) \\
			&\cdot L_{y} \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{y}}{2\pi} ( - k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} ) \right)
			\cdot L_{z} \text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right) \\
			=& L_{x} L_{y} L_{z} \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)
		\end{split}
		\label{eq:radar-intsol}
	\end{equation}
	where all angular dependence has been gathered in the function $\Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)$. This result is now inserted into the scattered field, giving
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}(\bm{r},t) &= \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu kr} \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{8\pi r K} L_{x} L_{y} L_{z} \left( \eu^{-\iu \Omega t} \Phi^+ (\theta,\phi)  + \eu^{\iu \Omega t} \Phi^- (\theta,\phi) \right) \\
		&= \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} E_\mrm{A}(\bm{r},t)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	
	By inspecting $E_\mrm{A}(\bm{r},t)$ it is clear that two frequency-shifted components arise. Since the implied time-dependence is $\eu^{-\iu \omega t}$, the factors $e^{\mp \iu \Omega t}$ give a frequency shift of $\pm \Omega$. The scattered field is written using two distinct components as
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_\mrm{sc} (\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^+ (\bm{r},t) + \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^- (\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \left( E_\mrm{A}^+ (\bm{r},t) + E_\mrm{A}^- (\bm{r},t) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu kr} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{8\pi r K} L_{x} L_{y} L_{z} e^{\mp \iu \Omega t} \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Solution in terms of power \label{sec:app-derivations-radar-power}}
	This treatment has primarily been focused around the electric field. To obtain a more practical expression, this is now transformed into power. The power is calculated for the individual frequency shifted components, since they are distinct and single-frequency. The time average for one frequency component of the Poynting vector is \cite{Kristensson2008}
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) &= \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Re}\left\{ \left( \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \eu^{-i\omega t} \right) \times \left( \bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^{\pm} (\bm{r}, t) \eu^{-i\omega t} \right)^* \right\} \\
		&= \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{Re}\left\{ \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \times \bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^{\pm} (\bm{r}, t)^* \right\}
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	where the time-dependence of the incident electromagnetic wave was re-introduced. The magnetic field $\bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t)$ is given by \cite{Kristensson2008}
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \approx \frac{1}{\iu k \eta_0 \eta} \nabla \times \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t)
	\end{equation*}
	where $\eta_0$ is the wave impedance of free space and $\eta_0 \eta$ the wave impedance in the material. An approximation has been made for $k$, where this is assumed to have the same value as before scattering. Since there is a frequency shift this is known to not be the case, but given a small acoustic frequency compared to the electromagnetic frequency, the error is small. The curl of $\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t)$ is now written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla \times \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) = \nabla \times (\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t)) = \nabla E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t) \times \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}
	\end{equation*}
	In spherical coordinates the gradient is written \addref
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial r} \bm{\hat{r}} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta} \bm{\hat{\theta}} + \frac{1}{r\sin{\theta}} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \phi} \bm{\hat{\phi}}
	\end{equation*}
	$E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r}, t)$ contains a factor $1/r$, so the two last terms in the gradient will be $\sim 1/r^2$ and are neglected. The gradient is now written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\nabla E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) &\approx \frac{\partial E_\mrm{A}}{\partial r} \bm{\hat{r}} \\
		&= \left( \frac{\iu k\eu^{\iu kr}}{r} - \frac{\eu^{\iu kr}}{r^2} \right) \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \mathfrak{p} p_0}{8\pi K} L_{x} L_{y} L_{z} \left( \eu^{- \iu \Omega t} \Phi^+ (\theta,\phi) + \eu^{\iu \Omega t} \Phi^- (\theta,\phi) \right) \bm{\hat{r}} \\
		&\approx \iu kE_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \bm{\hat{r}}
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	where the $1/r^2$ term was neglected. These results are inserted into the expression for the magnetic field, giving
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) = \frac{1}{\iu k \eta_0 \eta} (\iu kE_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \bm{\hat{r}} \times \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}) = \frac{E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r}, t)}{ \eta_0 \eta} \bm{\hat{r}} \times \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}
	\end{equation*}
	Now, the cross product with the electric field is calculated as
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \times \bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^{\pm} (\bm{r}, t)^* &= E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \times \left( \frac{E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r}, t)}{ \eta_0 \eta} \bm{\hat{r}} \times \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \right)^* \\
		&= \frac{|E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r}, t)|^2}{\eta_0 \eta} \left( \bm{\hat{r}} (\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \cdot \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}^*) - \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}^* (\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \cdot \bm{\hat{r}}) \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	In the far-field $\bm{E}_\mrm{sc} \cdot \bm{\hat{r}} = 0$ \addref and since $\bm{E}_\mrm{sc} \parallel \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}$ the cross product is simplified to
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \times \bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^{\pm} (\bm{r}, t)^* = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 |E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	The time-averaged Poynting vector is now calculated as
	\begin{equation*}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Re}\left\{ \bm{E}_\mrm{sc}^\pm (\bm{r}, t) \times \bm{H}_\mrm{sc}^{\pm} (\bm{r}, t)^* \right\} = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 |E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	where $|E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2$ is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		|E_\mrm{A}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2 = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{64\pi^2 r^2 K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 L_{z}^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	To find an expression for $|\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2$, the field from the transmitter antenna is written as (adapted from \cite{Orfanidis2016})
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{T} (\bm{r}) = \iu k\eta_0\eta \frac{\eu^{\iu kr}}{4\pi r} \bm{F}_\perp (\bm{\hat{r}})
	\end{equation*}
	where $\bm{F}_\perp$ is the far-field amplitude. Now the coordinate system is not the same as earlier in the derivation! Here it is a spherical coordinate system with origin at the transmitting antenna. This corresponds to a translation in $-\bm{\hat{x}}$ of the original coordinate system. Let $R_\mrm{T}$ be the distance between the two coordinate systems, or equivalently the distance from the transmitter to the scattering center. The direction to the scattering center in this new system is denoted $\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc} = \bm{r}_{sc}/R_\mrm{T}$. Assuming that the orientations of the transmitter and scattering coordinate systems are the same, $|\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2$ can be written in the transmitter system as \cite{Orfanidis2016}
	\begin{equation*}
		|\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 = |\bm{E}_\mrm{T}(\bm{r}_{sc})|^2 = \left| \iu k\eta_0\eta \frac{\eu^{\iu kR_\mrm{T}}}{4\pi R_\mrm{T}} \bm{F}_\perp (\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc}) \right|^2 = \frac{k^2 \eta_0^2 \eta^2}{16 \pi^2 R_\mrm{T}^2} |\bm{F}_\perp (\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc})|^2 = 2\eta_0 \eta \mathcal{P}(\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc})
	\end{equation*}
	If the maximum gain $G_\mrm{T}$ of the antenna is in the direction $\hat{r}_{sc}$, it holds that \cite{Orfanidis2016}
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathcal{P}(\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc}) = \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T}}{4\pi R_\mrm{T}^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $P_\mrm{T}$ is the power accepted by the antenna. This is used to write
	\begin{equation*}
		|\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 = 2\eta_0 \eta \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T}}{4\pi R_\mrm{T}^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Now this is inserted into the time-average of the power density
	\begin{equation*}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) = \bm{\hat{r}} \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T}}{4\pi R_\mrm{T}^2} \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{64\pi^2 r^2 K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 L_{z}^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	Now the effects of the receiving antenna are considered. It is assumed that this antenna is optimally directed towards the scattering center. The received power is then
	\begin{equation*}
		P_\mrm{R}^\pm = \left| \left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc}^\pm \right> (R_\mrm{R}, \theta, \phi) \right| A_\mrm{e}
	\end{equation*}
	where $R_\mrm{R}$ is the distance between the scattering center and the receiver, and the receiver is located in the direction $(\theta,\phi)$ as seen from the scattering center. $A_\mrm{e}$ is the effective area of the antenna, which can be rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
		A_\mrm{e} = \frac{\lambda_\mrm{R}^2 G_\mrm{R}}{4\pi}
	\end{equation*}
	where $G_\mrm{R}$ is the gain of the receiving antenna. $\lambda_\mrm{R}$ should be the wavelength at the antenna here, which is not necessarily the same as in the material. Combining this with earlier results gives a received power of
	\begin{equation*}
		P_\mrm{R}^\pm = \frac{\lambda_\mrm{R}^2 G_\mrm{R}}{4\pi} \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T}}{4\pi R_\mrm{T}^2} \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{64\pi^2 R_\mrm{R}^2 K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 L_{z}^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	For a more traditional bistatic radar equation \cite{Richards2012} this can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		P_\mrm{R}^\pm = \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{R} \lambda_\mrm{R}^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_\mrm{T}^2 R_\mrm{R}^2}
	\end{equation*}
	with the radar cross-section given by
	\begin{equation*}
		\sigma^\pm (\theta, \phi) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{16\pi K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 L_{z}^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Signal-to-noise ratio and coherent integration \label{sec:app-derivations-radar-SNR}}
	An important quantity besides received power is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For this, the average noise power is described as \cite{Young2004}
	\begin{equation*}
		P_\mrm{n} = k_\mrm{B} TB
	\end{equation*}
	where $k_\mrm{B}$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature and $B$ is the utilized receiver bandwidth. The noise power picked up by the antenna is calculated using the standard temperature $T_0 = 290$ K. The SNR directly at the antenna can thus be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathit{SNR}^\pm_\mrm{ant} \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{R} \lambda_\mrm{R}^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_\mrm{T}^2 R_\mrm{R}^2 k_\mrm{B} T_0 B}
	\end{equation*}
	After the antenna is the RF front-end which usually contains a bandpass filter, low-noise amplifier (LNA), and mixer. Here the received signal is amplified so that it can be further processed. The amplification affects both the signal and noise, but the electronic components add more noise which causes the SNR to deteriorate. To quantify this, the concept of noise ratio and noise figure is used. The noise ratio is defined as \cite{Young2004}
	\begin{equation*}
		F = \frac{\mathit{SNR}_\mrm{i}}{\mathit{SNR}_\mrm{o}}
	\end{equation*}
	where the SNR's are in linear units, i denotes input and o denotes output. It is more common to use noise figure, which is simply the noise ratio expressed in dB units, $\mathit{NF} = 10\log_{10}(F)$. After the RF front-end the signal is often strong enough to not be affected by further noise, so it is usually sufficient to use a noise ratio/figure for that part of the receiver. The SNR after the receiver can now be written using the noise ratio as
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathit{SNR}^\pm = \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{R} \lambda_\mrm{R}^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_\mrm{T}^2 R_\mrm{R}^2 k_\mrm{B} T_0 B \cdot F}
	\end{equation*}
	One more effect is added to this, and that is signal integration in the signal processing following the receiver. Noise can often be modeled as a random process, and if multiple samples are added together the noise can be averaged out. If coherent demodulation is used, $N$ samples added together will cause the SNR to improve by a factor $N$ \cite{Richards2012}. The SNR can then be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\mathit{SNR}^\pm_N = \frac{P_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{T} G_\mrm{R} \lambda_\mrm{R}^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_\mrm{T}^2 R_\mrm{R}^2 k_\mrm{B} T_0 B F} N
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Refined interaction region} \label{sec:app-derivations-radar-refined}
	The derivation in \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol} is based on plane waves and a very simple geometry. A problem with the geometry used is that there is no easy way to obtain the parameters $L_{x}$, $L_{y}$ and $L_{z}$ from common parameters of the acoustic and electromagnetic beams. To address this, a slightly different interaction geometry based on beams is introduced as shown in figure \ref{fig:parallelogram}. Here the beam diameters $d_\mrm{e}$ and $d_\mrm{a}$ have been introduced for the electromagnetic and acoustic plane waves. For simplicity, it is assumed that the beam edges are infinitely sharp, i.e. inside the wave behaves as a plane wave and outside it is zero. This way the previous derivation can be used with the exception of the interaction region.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
			\input{fig/parallelogram.tikz}
		}
		\caption{\label{fig:parallelogram} Parallelogram interaction region}
	\end{figure}
	Since plane waves are still used the model is not based on real beams. However, for real beams it is still easy to obtain widths at the overlap area and then the interaction region should be fairly close using this model.
	
	The integration limits corresponding to this parallelogram can be written as
	\begin{align*}
		x_0 - x_1 &< x < x_0 + x_1 \\
		-d_\mrm{e}/2 &< y < d_\mrm{e}/2 \\
		-L_{z}/2 &< z < L_{z}/2
	\end{align*}
	where
	\begin{align*}
		x_0 &= \frac{y}{\tan{\alpha}} \\
		x_1 &= \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{2\sin{\alpha}}
	\end{align*}
	The solution to the integral for a general function on the form $\eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{r}}$ is now written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
			I &= \int_{V_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' \\
			&= \int_{-L_{z}/2}^{L_{z}/2} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{z}} z'} \mathrm{d}z'
			\int_{-d_\mrm{e}/2}^{d_\mrm{e}/2} \left( \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{y}} y'}
			\int_{x_0-x_1}^{x_0+x_1} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} x'} \mathrm{d}x' \right) \mathrm{d}y' \\
			&= \int_{-L_{z}/2}^{L_{z}/2} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{z}} z'} \mathrm{d}z' \cdot I_2
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	using the solution from \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol} \todoint{Maybe make better references?} this integral can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		I = L_{z} \text{sinc}\left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{z}} L_{z}}{2\pi} \right) \cdot I_2
	\end{equation*}
	The integral $I_2$ can be solved as
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		I_2 &= \int_{-d_\mrm{e}/2}^{d_\mrm{e}/2} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{y}} y'}
		\cdot \frac{1}{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}}}
		\left( \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} (x_0+x_1)} - \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} (x_0-x_1)}\right) \mathrm{d}y' \\
		&=\int_{-d_\mrm{e}/2}^{d_\mrm{e}/2} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{y}} y'}
		\cdot \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} x_0} \frac{2}{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}}} \sin(\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} x_1) \mathrm{d}y' \\
		&=\int_{-d_\mrm{e}/2}^{d_\mrm{e}/2} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot (\bm{\hat{y}} y'+ \bm{\hat{x}} x_0)}
		\cdot 2x_1 \text{sinc}\left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} x_1}{\pi} \right) \mathrm{d}y' \\
		&= \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{\sin{\alpha}} \text{sinc}\left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} d_\mrm{a}}{2\pi \sin{\alpha}} \right) \int_{-d_\mrm{e}/2}^{d_\mrm{e}/2} \eu^{\iu \bm{A} \cdot (\bm{\hat{y}} + \bm{\hat{x}}/\tan{\alpha}) y'} \mathrm{d}y' \\
		&= \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{\sin{\alpha}} \text{sinc}\left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} d_\mrm{a}}{2\pi \sin{\alpha}} \right) \cdot I_3
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	The integral $I_3$ can be solved analogously to the solution from \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar} as
	\begin{equation*}
		I_3 = d_\mrm{e} \text{sinc}\left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot (\bm{\hat{y}} + \bm{\hat{x}}/\tan{\alpha}) d_\mrm{e}}{2\pi} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Now the complete solution to $I$ is written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		I =& \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{\sin{\alpha}} \text{sinc}\left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} d_\mrm{a}}{2\pi \sin{\alpha}} \right) \cdot d_\mrm{e} \text{sinc}\left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot (\bm{\hat{y}} + \bm{\hat{x}}/\tan{\alpha}) d_\mrm{e}}{2\pi} \right) \\
		&\cdot L_{z} \text{sinc}\left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{z}} L_{z}}{2\pi} \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	If the specific function of interest to the scattering problem is inserted, and spherical coordinates are used as in equation \eqref{eq:radar-Aproj} the solution is
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\int_{V_\mrm{sc}} &\eu^{\iu (	k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) \pm \bm{q}) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' \\
		&= \frac{d_\mrm{a} d_\mrm{e} L_{z}}{\sin{\alpha}} \text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{2\pi \sin{\alpha}}(k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha}) \right) \\
		&\cdot \text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{e}}{2\pi \tan{\alpha}}
		(k - k\sin{\theta}(\cos{\phi} + \sin{\phi}\tan{\alpha}) \pm q(\cos{\alpha} + \sin{\alpha}\tan{\alpha})) \right) \\
		&\cdot \text{sinc}\left( -\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right) \\
		&= \frac{d_\mrm{a} d_\mrm{e} L_{z}}{\sin{\alpha}} \Phi_\mrm{p}^{\pm}(\theta, \phi)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	where the function $\Phi_\mrm{p}^{\pm}(\theta, \phi)$ was introduced similarly to $\Phi^{\pm}(\theta, \phi)$ in equation \eqref{eq:radar-intsol}. In contrast to the derivation in \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar}, $\Phi_\mrm{p}^{\pm}(\theta, \phi)$ does not contain all angular dependence since there is still a factor $1/\sin{\alpha}$ not included. This is due to that factor being directly related to the interaction volume. If the area of the parallelogram is calculated and multiplied by the width in $z$, the result is
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{d_\mrm{a} d_\mrm{e} L_{z}}{\sin{\alpha}}
	\end{equation*}
	This means that the solution of the integral is the interaction volume multiplied by $\Phi_\mrm{p}^{\pm}(\theta, \phi)$. This is the same result as in equation \eqref{eq:radar-intsol}.
	
	For the major results of the derivations in section \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar}, the interaction region is easily changed from cuboid to beam-based. The geometry only matters in the calculation of the integral, so the only necessary changes are from there. This means that the interaction volume needs to be changed from $L_{x} L_{y} L_{z}$ to $d_\mrm{a} d_\mrm{e} L_{z}/\sin{\alpha}$ and the function $\Phi^\pm$ changed to $\Phi_\mrm{p}^\pm$.  With this in mind, the results from section \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol}-\ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-SNR} are rewritten using these changes. First, the scattered power is written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc,p} (\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \left( E_\mrm{A,p}^+ (\bm{r},t) + E_\mrm{A,p}^- (\bm{r},t) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		E_\mrm{A,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu kr} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{8\pi r K} \frac{d_\mrm{a} d_\mrm{e} L_{z}}{\sin{\alpha}} e^{\mp \iu \Omega t} \Phi_\mrm{p}^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{equation*}
	The radar equations are unchanged if a new radar cross-section is used, written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\sigma_\mrm{p}^\pm (\theta, \phi) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^4 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{16\pi K^2} \frac{d_\mrm{a}^2 d_\mrm{e}^2 L_{z}^2}{\sin^2{\alpha}} \Phi_\mrm{p}^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	As stated before, these equations are quite similar to those from the cuboid geometry.
	
	\subsection{2D derivations} \label{sec:app-derivations-radar-2d}
	The derivations leading to the radar equation in appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter} and \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol}-\ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-power} are based on the assumption of three dimensional space. While this is reasonable for modeling reality, simulations are often done in two dimensions for computational speed and simplicity. If the analytical model is to be compared with 2D simulation results, a 2D analytical model is necessary. The first thing to identify in order to achieve this goal is where the first assumption of 3D space is done. This is in the solution of the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation, so that is where this 2D derivation must start. It is assumed that the condition $v/c << |\varepsilon_1|/\varepsilon_\mrm{r}$ holds, which allows for some terms to be ignored (see appendix \ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter-approx}), giving
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2\bm{E}_\mrm{sc} + k^2 \bm{E}_\mrm{sc} = \\
		-k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \bm{E}_\mrm{i} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}}\nabla(\bm{E}_\mrm{i} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1)
	\end{equation*}
	This has a similar solution in 2D as in 3D, but with a different Green's function. The solution to this in two dimensions, and under a Sommerfeld radiation condition \addref is instead
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc,2D}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \int_{S_\mrm{sc}} & \frac{\iu}{4} H_0^{(1)}( k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|) \\
		&\cdot \left( k^2 \bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r'},t) \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t) + \nabla (\bm{E}_\mrm{i} (\bm{r'},t) \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t)) \right) \mathrm{d}s'
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	where $H_0^{(1)}$ is a Hankel function. The same geometry as in \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol} can now be used to calculate the scattered field (see figure \ref{fig:app-radar-geom}). The change is that the interaction region is now limited to the $xy$-plane, as are coordinates for the observation point. The incident fields are defined as in equations \eqref{eq:app-radar-planeE} and \eqref{eq:app-radar-planeEps}, but with the coordinates $\bm{r}'$ being 2D, i.e. $\bm{r}' = x'\bm{\hat{x}} + y'\bm{\hat{y}}$. The polarization of the incident electric field, however, is still in z regardless of the 2D geometry otherwise used. This can be done since it is not dependent on the coordinate $z$, only the unit vector $\bm{\hat{z}}$. Insertion of the incident fields now gives
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc,2D}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{k^2}{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}} \int_{S_\mrm{sc}} \frac{\iu}{4} H_0^{(1)}( k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|) \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \eu^{\iu \bm{k} \cdot \bm{r}'} \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 \mathfrak{p}}{K} p_0 \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t) \mathrm{d}s'
	\end{equation*}
	Assumption of far-field can be used to approximate the Hankel function. This is done as \addref \todo[inline]{\url{http://www.cv.titech.ac.jp/~hiro-lab/lecture/Vibration_Wave_Analysis/text-9.pdf}}
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{\iu}{4} H_0^{(1)}( k |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|) \approx \frac{\eu^{\iu (kr + \pi/4)}}{\sqrt{8\pi kr}} \eu^{-\iu k \bm{\hat{r}} \cdot \bm{r}'}
	\end{equation*}
	which is inserted in the integral, giving
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc,2D}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu (kr + \pi/4)} \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{K \sqrt{8\pi kr}} \int_{S_\mrm{sc}} \eu^{\iu k ( \bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t) \mathrm{d}s'
	\end{equation*}
	Inspection of this equation shows that it is the same integral as the one solved in section \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-sol}, but in 2D instead of 3D. All other differences are in the factor in front of the integral. Thus, the scattered field can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc,2D} (\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \left( E_\mrm{A,2D}^+ (\bm{r},t) + E_\mrm{A,2D}^- (\bm{r},t) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		E_\mrm{A,2D}^\pm (\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu (kr + \pi/4)} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{K \sqrt{8\pi kr}} L_{x} L_{y} e^{\mp \iu \Omega t} \Phi_\mrm{2D}^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{equation*}
		\Phi_\mrm{2D}^\pm (\theta,\phi) = \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{x}}{2\pi} ( k - k\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} ) \right) \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{y}}{2\pi} ( - k\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} ) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Since the integral was calculated in 2D instead of 3D this time, the $L_z$ factor was removed as well as one of the sinc functions in $\Phi$. The argument of the sinc functions was also slightly altered since $\sin{\theta} = 1$ in the xy-plane. Calculation of the Poynting vector is unaffected by the change from 3D to 2D, with an exception being the change in $E_A^\pm$. The time-average of the Poynting vector is then written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc,2D}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 |E_\mrm{A,2D}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	where $|E_\mrm{A,2D}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2$ is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		|E_\mrm{A,2D}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2 = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^3 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{8\pi r K^2} L_{x}^2 L_{y}^2 \Phi_\mrm{2D}^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	The parallelogram geometry introduced in section \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-refined} can be used in 2D to refine the interaction region. As discussed in section \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar-refined}, using this geometry only affects the interaction region factors and the $\Phi$ function. The scattered field using this interaction region is then written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\bm{E}_\mrm{sc,2D,p} (\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0} \left( E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^+ (\bm{r},t) + E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^- (\bm{r},t) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
		E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}k^2 \eu^{\iu (kr + \pi/4)} \mathfrak{p} p_0}{K \sqrt{8\pi kr}} \frac{d_\mrm{a} d_\mrm{e}}{\sin{\alpha}} e^{\mp \iu \Omega t} \Phi_\mrm{2D,p}^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\Phi_\mrm{2D,p}^\pm (\theta,\phi) = &\text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{2\pi \sin{\alpha}}(k - k\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha}) \right) \\
		\cdot &\text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{e}}{2\pi \tan{\alpha}}
		(k - k(\cos{\phi} + \sin{\phi}\tan{\alpha}) \pm q(\cos{\alpha} + \sin{\alpha}\tan{\alpha})) \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	The Poynting vector is also written down as
	\begin{equation*}
		\left< \bm{S}_\mrm{sc,2D,p}^\pm \right> (\bm{r}) = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{\mrm{i}0}|^2 |E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	where $|E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2$ is given by
	\begin{equation*}
		|E_\mrm{A,2D,p}^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2 = \frac{\varepsilon_\mrm{r}^2 k^3 \mathfrak{p}^2 p_0^2}{8\pi r K^2} \frac{d_\mrm{a}^2 d_\mrm{e}^2}{\sin^2{\alpha}} \Phi_\mrm{2D}^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	\section{Geometry for maximum scattering \label{sec:app-derivations-bragg}}
	Let us begin with the $\Phi$ angular dependence function:
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
		\Phi^\pm(\theta,\phi) =& \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{x}}{2\pi} \left( k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} \right) \right) \\
		\cdot& \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_{y}}{2\pi} \left( -k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} \right) \right) \\
		\cdot& \text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right)
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}
	The maximum of this function mush be where all sinc-functions are maximum. For a sinc the maximum is given when the argument is equal to 0, which simplifies the process. Firstly, consider the third sinc:
	\begin{equation*}
		\text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	The argument of this is obviously zero when $\cos{\theta} = 0$, which for $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ is when $\theta = \pi/2$. This fixes the maximum to the plane formed by the incident electromagnetic and acoustic wavevectors. What it means is that the scattering occurs primarily in one single interaction plane, which simplifies analysis. Now the arguments of the two other sinc functions are set to zero with the value for $\theta$ being set to $\pi/2$:
	\begin{align}
		k - k\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} &= 0 \label{eq:app-bragg-sinc1} \\
		-k\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} &= 0 \label{eq:app-bragg-sinc2}
	\end{align}
	
	\subsection{Condition for $\alpha$}
	The system \eqref{eq:app-bragg-sinc1},\eqref{eq:app-bragg-sinc2} is now used to find the angle between wavevectors giving a maximum. To avoid confusion, the positive and negative versions of the system are considered separately.
	
	\subsubsection{(+) case}
	Begin with equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-sinc1}:
	\begin{equation*}
		\cos{\alpha} = \frac{k}{q}\left( \cos{\phi} - 1 \right) = \frac{k}{q}\left( \pm \sqrt{1-\sin^2{\phi}} - 1 \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Now equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-sinc2} is inserted in the above as
	\begin{equation*}
		\cos{\alpha} = \frac{k}{q}\left( \pm \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{k^2}\sin^2{\alpha}} - 1 \right)
	\end{equation*}
	This is rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
		\pm \sqrt{k^2-q^2\sin^2{\alpha}} = q\cos{\alpha} + k
	\end{equation*}
	And squared
	\begin{equation*}
		k^2 - q^2\sin^2{\alpha} = q^2\cos^2{\alpha} + 2kq\cos{\alpha} + k^2
	\end{equation*}
	After some simplification, the following equation is obtained:
	\begin{equation}
		\cos{\alpha} = -\frac{q}{2k} \label{eq:app-bragg-cos+}
	\end{equation}
	Since $q$ and $k$ are non-negative it is clear that $\pi/2 \leq \alpha \leq \pi$.
	
	\subsubsection{(-) case}
	This case is the same as the (+) case, but with some sign changes. Begin with equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-sinc1}:
	\begin{equation*}
		\cos{\alpha} = \frac{k}{q}\left( 1 - \cos{\phi} \right) = \frac{k}{q}\left( 1 \pm \sqrt{1-\sin^2{\phi}} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Now equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-sinc2} is inserted in the above as
	\begin{equation*}
		\cos{\alpha} = \frac{k}{q}\left( 1 \pm \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{k^2}\sin^2{\alpha}} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	This is rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
		\pm \sqrt{k^2-q^2\sin^2{\alpha}} = q\cos{\alpha} - k
	\end{equation*}
	And squared
	\begin{equation*}
		k^2 - q^2\sin^2{\alpha} = q^2\cos^2{\alpha} - 2kq\cos{\alpha} + k^2
	\end{equation*}
	After some simplification, the following equation is obtained:
	\begin{equation}
		\cos{\alpha} = \frac{q}{2k} \label{eq:app-bragg-cos-}
	\end{equation}
	Since $q$ and $k$ are non-negative it is clear that $0 \leq \alpha \leq \pi/2$.

	\subsection{Condition for $\phi$}
	If either of equations \eqref{eq:app-bragg-cos+} or \eqref{eq:app-bragg-cos-} is inserted in the system \eqref{eq:app-bragg-sinc1}, \eqref{eq:app-bragg-sinc2} the following is obtained:
	\begin{align*}
		\cos{\phi} &= 1 - 2\cos^2{\alpha} = -\cos{2\alpha} \\
		\sin{\phi} &= -2\sin{\alpha}\cos{\alpha} = -\sin{2\alpha}
	\end{align*}
	These can be written as
	\begin{align*}
		\phi &=
		\begin{cases}
			\arccos(-\cos{2\alpha}) + 2\pi n &= \pi - 2\alpha + 2\pi n \\
			2\pi - \arccos(-\cos{2\alpha}) + 2\pi n &= \pi + 2\alpha + 2\pi n
		\end{cases} \\
		\phi &=
		\begin{cases}
			\arcsin(-\sin{2\alpha}) + 2\pi n &= -2\alpha + 2\pi n \\
			\pi - \arcsin(-\sin{2\alpha}) + 2\pi n &= \pi + 2\alpha + 2\pi n
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	Where $n$ is an integer. From these equations it is clear that $\phi = \pi + 2\alpha + 2\pi n$ is the only valid solution. If $\phi$ is constrained by $0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi$ and $\alpha$ is constrained by $\pi/2 < \alpha < \pi$ (+) or $0 < \alpha < \pi/2$ (-), $\phi$ can be written as
	\begin{align*}
		\phi &= -\pi + 2\alpha \text{ (+ case)}\\
		\phi &= \pi + 2\alpha \text{ (- case)}
	\end{align*}
	
	\subsection{Summary}
	The equations for both the (+) and (-) case are very similar, and can be written in a simple way using $\pm$ signs. The conditions define the geometry which gives the maximum scattering through the angle $\alpha$ between EM and acoustic incident waves and the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ for the receiver direction. They are summarized below:
	\begin{align}
		\theta &= \pi/2 \label{eq:app-bragg-theta}\\
		\cos{\alpha} = \mp \frac{q}{2k} &= \mp \frac{\lambda}{2\Lambda} \label{eq:app-bragg-alpha}\\
		\phi &= \mp \pi + 2\alpha \label{eq:app-bragg-phi}
	\end{align}
	
	In acousto-optics the interaction occurs in a single plane, which is what \eqref{eq:app-bragg-theta} describes. There is also a Bragg condition defining the angle between an acoustic and optic wave which is required for maximum reflection. This is presented in \cite{Saleh2007} as
	\begin{equation*}
		\sin{\theta_\mrm{B}} = \frac{\lambda}{2\Lambda}
	\end{equation*}
	The relationship between the angles in acousto-optics and those used in this model are shown in figure \ref{fig:bragg-comparison} with $\phi_\mrm{i} = \phi_\mrm{r} = \theta_\mrm{B}$ \cite{Saleh2007}. From the figure it is clear that $\alpha = \pi/2 \pm \theta_\mrm{B}$. In this model \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha} is used to obtain the optimal angle between electromagnetic and acoustic waves, and the transformation between $\alpha$ and $\theta_\mrm{B}$ can be inserted as
	\begin{equation*}
		\cos{\alpha} = \cos(\pi/2 \pm \theta_\mrm{B}) = \mp \sin{\theta_\mrm{B}}
	\end{equation*}
	The RHS of \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha} is $\mp \lambda/2\Lambda$. This should be equal to the RHS above, which directly gives the Bragg condition.
	
	In acousto-optics it is assumed that the reflection angle equals the incidence angle. This is not directly stated here, but can be obtained by changing from the angles $\alpha$, $\phi$ to the incidence angle $\phi_\mrm{i}$ and reflection angle $\phi_\mrm{r}$ shown in figure \ref{fig:bragg-comparison}. It is clear from the figure that
	\begin{align*}
		\phi_\mrm{i} &= \pm(\alpha - \pi/2) \\
		\phi_\mrm{r} &=
		\begin{cases}
			\phi - \phi_\mrm{i} &\text{ (+ case)} \\
			2\pi - \phi - \phi_\mrm{i} &\text{ (- case)}
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	Now the condition for $\phi_\mrm{i}$ and \eqref{eq:app-bragg-phi} are inserted in the condition for $\phi_\mrm{r}$, giving
	\begin{equation*}
		\phi_\mrm{r} =
		\begin{cases}
			-\pi + 2\alpha - (\alpha - \pi/2) = \alpha - \pi/2 = \phi_\mrm{i} &\text{ (+ case)}\\
			2\pi - (\pi + 2\alpha) + (\alpha - \pi/2) = \pi/2 - \alpha = \phi_\mrm{i} &\text{ (- case)}
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
	and thus, the equation for $\alpha$ is also in agreement with acousto-optics. So, from simple variable substitutions the same results as in acousto-optics are obtained. This gives the model some validation since it is in agreement with an already established theory.

\subsection{Refined interaction region \label{sec:app-derivations-bragg-refined}}
For the refined interaction region described in section \ref{sec:app-derivations-refined} the derivation for finding a maximum scattering geometry is different than above. However, a first hypothesis would be that the resulting condition would be the same. To test this, the angles described by equations \eqref{eq:app-bragg-theta}, \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha}, \eqref{eq:app-bragg-phi} are inserted in $\Phi_\mrm{p}^{\pm}(\theta, \phi)$ from section \ref{sec:app-derivations-refined}. The function can be written as
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	\Phi_\mrm{p}^{\pm}(\theta, \phi) &= \text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{a}}{2\pi \sin{\alpha}}(k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha}) \right) \\
	&\cdot \text{sinc}\left( \frac{d_\mrm{e}}{2\pi \tan{\alpha}}
	(k - k\sin{\theta}(\cos{\phi} + \sin{\phi}\tan{\alpha}) \pm q(\cos{\alpha} + \sin{\alpha}\tan{\alpha})) \right) \\
	&\cdot \text{sinc}\left( -\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
As for the function used in derivations for the cuboid geometry, the maximum value of this function is 1. This happens only when the arguments of all sinc's are 0. Due to this fact, the problem is simplified by only considering the parts of the arguments required to be zero, namely
\begin{numcases}{}
	k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} \label{eq:app-bragg-ref1} \\
	k - k\sin{\theta}(\cos{\phi} + \sin{\phi}\tan{\alpha}) \pm q(\cos{\alpha} + \sin{\alpha}\tan{\alpha} \label{eq:app-bragg-ref2} \\
	-\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \label{eq:app-bragg-ref3}
\end{numcases}
Now the equations \eqref{eq:app-bragg-theta}, \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha}, \eqref{eq:app-bragg-phi} are inserted. In the derivations the following relations are well used
\begin{align*}
	\cos(\mp \pi + 2\alpha) &= \sin^2{\alpha} - \cos^2{\alpha} \\
	\sin(\mp \pi + 2\alpha) &= -2\sin{\alpha}\cos{\alpha} \\
	q &= \mp 2k\cos{\alpha}
\end{align*}
Argument \eqref{eq:app-bragg-ref1} is now written as
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	k &- k\sin(\pi/2)\cos(\mp \pi + 2\alpha) \pm q\cos{\alpha} = k \left( 1 - (\sin^2{\alpha} - \cos^2{\alpha}) \pm (\mp 2\cos^2{\alpha}) \right) \\
	&= k \left( 1 - \sin^2{\alpha} - \cos^2{\alpha} \right) = 0
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Since it is equal to zero, the first sinc is maximized. Now argument \eqref{eq:app-bragg-ref2} is written as
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
	k &- k\sin(\pi/2)(\cos(\mp \pi + 2\alpha) + \sin(\mp \pi + 2\alpha)\tan{\alpha}) \pm q(\cos{\alpha} + \sin{\alpha}\tan{\alpha} \\
	&= k \left( 1 - (\sin^2{\alpha} - \cos^2{\alpha} - 2\sin{\alpha}\cos{\alpha}\tan{\alpha}) \pm (\mp 2\cos{\alpha})(\cos{\alpha} + \sin{\alpha}\tan{\alpha}) \right) \\
	&= k \left( 1 - \sin^2{\alpha} + \cos^2{\alpha} + 2\sin^2{\alpha} - 2\cos^2{\alpha} - 2\sin^2{\alpha} \right) \\
	&= k \left( 1 - \sin^2{\alpha} - \cos^2{\alpha} \right) = 0
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Since it is equal to zero, the second sinc is maximized. Finally, argument \eqref{eq:app-bragg-ref3} is written as
\begin{equation*}
	-\frac{L_{z}}{2\pi} k\cos{\pi/2} = 0
\end{equation*}
Since it is equal to zero, the third sinc is also maximized. Thus, all sinc functions are maximized which maximizes $\Phi_\mrm{p}^{\pm}$. This shows that the same condition (equations \eqref{eq:app-bragg-theta}, \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha}, \eqref{eq:app-bragg-phi}) maximizes the $\Phi$ function for both the simple cuboid geometry and the refined geometry based on beams.

One difference is that there is a factor $1/\sin{\alpha}$ in the parallelogram interaction region while the cuboid interaction region is constant. This should affect the angle $\alpha$ giving maximum scattering in the parallelogram case. To find a maximum of this and not just the function $\Phi$ would require other derivations than those done for maximizing three sinc functions. Since this was not done, this factor should be kept in mind when discussing Bragg matching. One thing which can be noted though is how the factor might change the peak scattering qualitatively. The square of the factor $1/\sin^2{\alpha}$ is what matters for the scattered power. This has a minimum at $\alpha = \pi/2$ and increases as $\alpha$ tends towards 0 or $\pi$. What this means for the total scattering is that the decrease in scattering when moving away from the $\alpha$ given by equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha} can be slightly counteracted. In the (-) case, $0 < \alpha < \pi/2$, so $1/\sin^2{\alpha}$ is larger at smaller angles than the one given by equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha}. Due to this, the maximum scattering can be shifted to a smaller angle $\alpha$. Similarly, in the (+) case, $\pi/2 < \alpha < \pi$, so $1/\sin^2{\alpha}$ is larger at larger angles than from equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha}. Maximum scattering can then be shifted to a larger $\alpha$. The size of the shift in $\alpha$ depends on how fast $\Phi$ decreases when the angle $\alpha$ tends away from that in equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha}. The function $\Phi$ is comprised of sinc functions, and the main factor determining this is the width of the main lobe of the sinc's. This is determined from the argument of the functions, which in turn depend on the geometry of the problem. Once again, the derivation is not done but it is noted that the exact geometry can have an effect on how large the shift in $\alpha$ is when compared to the Bragg maximum from equation \eqref{eq:app-bragg-alpha}.
