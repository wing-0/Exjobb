The article describes nondestructive evaluation using both electromagnetics and acoustics. The way this is done is by exciting the target (in this case a dielectric cylinder, but any geometry should be possible according to the authors) acoustically and imaging it electromagnetically. The target must resonate acoustically as this affects the electromagnetic waves by causing a Doppler shift in the scattered field. The Doppler component of the scattered field is highly sensitive to the shape of the acoustic resonance mode, and if there is a flaw in the target this can be measured as the acoustic mode then changes. The signal processing part is described more than the acousto-electromagnetic theory (time-reversal focusing is used), but this is less relevant to me.

The relevance to our application:

1. It might be possible to use the method described as is if acoustic resonance is obtained. However, there might be difficulties with using the existing mm-wave imaging together with this (more research is required to determine this). Also, the acoustic properties of honeycomb nomex composites are quite complex, so it may not be an efficient way forward due to this.

2. The concept of acoustic resonance might be necessary to look into more even if another approach is taken with the imaging. If the acoustic properties of the sample are correct for it, resonance might occur in the sample. A more acousto-optical approach only takes into account the density modulation inside the sample (this is one of the two mechanisms described in the paper). An object in resonance should also have the second mechanism of surface movement being strong, which is not considered in acousto-optics.

3. Would it be possible to excite the defects into acoustic resonance? That would be more like the ground penetrating radar described somewhat in Lawrence2001.},

This is a review on different acoustic-optical tomography methods in medicine. Much of the paper discusses topics very unrelated to my work (specific ways of utilizing the interaction medically, optical detection methods etc.). The relevant parts might be the interaction mechanisms.

All mechanisms of acousto-optical interaction are not necessarily relevant for my work. They present three mechanisms: one where ultrasound displaces scatterers which causes phase change in the light, one where ultrasound changes the index of refraction which causes phase change in the light, and one where ultrasound modulates the density which changes optical properties of the material. The third mechanism is very general and can be seen in many other texts such as Fundamentals of Photonics and the Michigan papers (Lawrence2001, Buerkle2008-2009). The two first mechanisms however, might not be as relevant to this work as it is to medical applications. The reason behind this is that while optical frequencies might scatter against molecules and other small-scale objects which can be displaced and such, these scatterers are too small to affect mm-waves in the same way. However, this should be explored further by reading more on those two interaction mechanisms.

Especially the reference list could be important since it contains a lot.},

One important detail to note from this article is in the interaction mechanism part. Here it is said that scatterer displacement is on the order of 1 nm, which is of course not relevant for mm-waves. The main idea of scatterers affecting photons as used in these medical applications should then not be relevant for mm-waves.},
