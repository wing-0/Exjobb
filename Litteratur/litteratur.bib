The article describes nondestructive evaluation using both electromagnetics and acoustics. The way this is done is by exciting the target (in this case a dielectric cylinder, but any geometry should be possible according to the authors) acoustically and imaging it electromagnetically. The target must resonate acoustically as this affects the electromagnetic waves by causing a Doppler shift in the scattered field. The Doppler component of the scattered field is highly sensitive to the shape of the acoustic resonance mode, and if there is a flaw in the target this can be measured as the acoustic mode then changes. The signal processing part is described more than the acousto-electromagnetic theory (time-reversal focusing is used), but this is less relevant to me.

The relevance to our application:

1. It might be possible to use the method described as is if acoustic resonance is obtained. However, there might be difficulties with using the existing mm-wave imaging together with this (more research is required to determine this). Also, the acoustic properties of honeycomb nomex composites are quite complex, so it may not be an efficient way forward due to this.

2. The concept of acoustic resonance might be necessary to look into more even if another approach is taken with the imaging. If the acoustic properties of the sample are correct for it, resonance might occur in the sample. A more acousto-optical approach only takes into account the density modulation inside the sample (this is one of the two mechanisms described in the paper). An object in resonance should also have the second mechanism of surface movement being strong, which is not considered in acousto-optics.

3. Would it be possible to excite the defects into acoustic resonance? That would be more like the ground penetrating radar described somewhat in Lawrence2001.},

This is a review on different acoustic-optical tomography methods in medicine. Much of the paper discusses topics very unrelated to my work (specific ways of utilizing the interaction medically, optical detection methods etc.). The relevant parts might be the interaction mechanisms.

All mechanisms of acousto-optical interaction are not necessarily relevant for my work. They present three mechanisms: one where ultrasound displaces scatterers which causes phase change in the light, one where ultrasound changes the index of refraction which causes phase change in the light, and one where ultrasound modulates the density which changes optical properties of the material. The third mechanism is very general and can be seen in many other texts such as Fundamentals of Photonics and the Michigan papers (Lawrence2001, Buerkle2008-2009). The two first mechanisms however, might not be as relevant to this work as it is to medical applications. The reason behind this is that while optical frequencies might scatter against molecules and other small-scale objects which can be displaced and such, these scatterers are too small to affect mm-waves in the same way. However, this should be explored further by reading more on those two interaction mechanisms.

Especially the reference list could be important since it contains a lot.},

One interesting part is that of reflectance (p. 812), which seems to be inversely proportional to the fourth power of the frequency. This might be a problem if the acousto-optic principles are used at mm-wave instead of optical wavelengths. The reflectance can be seen as a measure of the interaction strength since zero reflectance leads to an optical wave not being affected at all by the acoustic wave. If it is too low, then the interaction cannot be measured anymore. However, it might not be as big an issue as initially thought since other parameters are related to lambda. If the acoustic wavelength and interaction distance (acoustic/EM overlap) are scaled together with the EM wavelength the value should stay constant.

In part B* Coupled-Wave Theory there might be a problem in assumptions. It is supposed to be another derivation, and looks more general at first glance since it's based on Maxwell and not wave optics. However, one assumption which is seen in the derivation in section 5.2B (which is directly used in this section) relies on a dielectric variation slow enough that it can be seen as constant within distances on the order of an EM wavelength. This might be the case for acoustic and EM beams at nearly normal incidence which is used much in acousto-optics. But it might be more interesting for me to have nearly coincidential beams which would lead to the acoustic wavelength actually being smaller than the EM one. In that case the assumption in section 5.2B is completely false. I might need to redo the derivation with correct assumptions if I end up using this.},

The described method uses focused ultrasound, which is one of the techniques we have been discussing before. The way it works is that a focused ultrasound beam is amplitude modulated to create sinusoidally varying acoustic radiation force in its focus. The force causes harmonic motion in the part of the sample in under ultrasonic focus. This harmonic motion casues incoming microwaves to be Doppler shifted by the vibration frequency (which is twice the AM frequency). The Doppler component of scattered microwaves can then be measured. If the ultrasonic beam is scanned, the Doppler readings will give information on properties of the scanned material. The different properties contributing to the level of the Doppler component are primarily acoustic, elastic and electromagnetic properties. However, if the material is not completely homogeneous different scattering parts inside of the material complicates the picture. The scatterer size then becomes important as well. Vibration frequency also plays a part in the Doppler level.

Frequency of tissue vibration is twice the frequency of modulation in the ultrasonic beam. This is probably reasonable, but I need to be sure of why this is. After further reading it seems like they use different equations for this in different papers. Probably depends on how you define and generate your AM signal.

Throughout the derivations it is assumed that reflections of ultrasound are small. This might not be the case for laminated composite materials since the interface between layers might be a cause of reflections (if the difference in acoustic properties is large enough). Something to think about if this method is considered.

One issue with this method when compared with my work is that here the ultrasonic probe is scanned and the microwave equipment is static. My work relates to a mm-wave imaging system with a scanning mm-wave probe. To scan both a mm-wave probe and ultrasonic probe is totally unfeasible since the scan time would increase quadratically.},

The method is based around imaging permittivity in a sample. It seems like they use two measurements: one with only electromagnetism and one with both acoustics and electromagnetism. The second measurement is where the acoustic waves alter the distribution of permittivity inside of the sample. Based upon these measurements it is somehow possible to recover the unperturbed permittivity distribution with a higher resolution than a standard electromagnetic-only measurement would give.

I can't find much information on interaction mechanisms in the paper, probably because they don't really rely on measuring the acousto-electromagnetic interaction directly (although this might be the case, but only hidden behind a massive amount of notation). The main mechanism is based on acoustic waves altering the permittivity, but I can't find anything more clear than that. While other papers usually look directly at a frequency shift caused by the interaction, this paper has a less direct method.

I'm very unsure if the methods described here are even applicable to our problem. Need to read this paper more times to be even close to answering that.},

The two beams overlap in one spot where the interference leads to amplitude modulation fd = f2 - f1. This leads to objects becoming acoustic sources which is used in the article, which in itself is then used. But when objects in the intersection have a fd movement, there should be a fd doppler shift of EM waves in that region, but nowhere else.

Section 1.4 has a good overview of previous work where I can probably find good references.

Section 2.2 on tumour detection has lots of info on different ways ultrasound is used, and how it could be used together with EM waves. For example, ultrasound might be used to get depth resolution in samples which are not thin sheets (this was one other possible path for a thesis I could take within this project so it seems relevant). The possibility of using localized harmonic motion (as used in vibro-acoustography) is also explored.

Section 2.3 discusses non destrutive evaluation, which is obviously of interest. The background is discussed more than in Buerkle2009, but the method is the same.

In the later chapters it is much more focused on the specific implementation of their model. This is less relevant now in the beginning of my work than the general information in the earlier parts.},

Very interesting since the results from vibrating targets show that the frequency shift should vary with time, something that has not been stated in any of the articles on resonating objects. Maybe this is due to the fact that the derivation here uses point scatterers? Or maybe it has to do with what they actually mean when they say that the scatterer is rotating? Need to find more information on this so I can see what is actually the correct way of thinking here.

In Chen2003 I was confused with how the vibration would cause a frequency modulation and thought this was different from what the other articles were saying. Here, there is much more clear mention of the actual sidebands which are created next to any regular Doppler line (or carrier if there is no bulk movement and corresponding Doppler shift). They also expand the frequency modulation into Bessel functions and show that the sidebands are separated by a frequency corresponding to the vibration frequency. This shows that there is agreement between this and the other articles where acoustic resonance was said to give a frequency shift of the acoustic frequency. The only difference is that all sidebands are considered here (there is an infinite amount), where the other articles only consider the first (and strongest) sidebands corresponding to Bessel functions of order 0 (no shift) and 1 (shift of +/- vibration frequency).

Section II contains the derivation of the micro-Doppler model which is interesting. The later sections (III and onwards) are more on other subjects, and do not seem as important to my work at the moment.},

Raster-scanning the radiation force over the object and recording the amplitude and phase of the emitted sound resulted in data from which images related to the elastic compositions of the acoustically emitting objects could be computed.

It does, however, not have any electromagnetic components so the conclusions leading to acoustic emission here need to be transferred to electromagnetic scattering somehow. What is seen here is that if a small part in an object has different acoustic properties than the rest of the object, its acoustic radiation force will be different. The way this is seen is by an acoustic emission that is different than that of the rest of the object when the focus of the ultrasonic beams is on the anomalus part. This should also be possible to see electromagnetically since the acoustic emission of the ultrasonic focus is connected to its vibration. Stronger vibrations give rise to stronger Doppler-components in the electromagnetic return signal, so if an object has different acoustic properties these should be visible electromagnetically as well.},

Reading on acousto-vibrography in NDT/E is useful for understanding if the combination with electromagnetics can be used (as in Top2016 for medical).

The theory derivations are a bit hard to understand, mainly since I don't know much acoustics (let alone nonlinear acoustics which is used here). The results part is more interesting since they actually use a composite with aerospace applications and make dents in it. Defects inside of the plate were visible when transmission mode (both sum and difference) was used. Surface defects were visible when reflection mode sum frequency was used. I'm not sure how these modes would transfer if electromagnetic waves are used, but at least the interaction between ultrsound and defects is there. Another interesting detail is that they consider the sum frequency to have more modes of interaction than the difference (for example with radiation force). This would be good since a sum frequency vibration would be easier to detect using Doppler measurements than the difference frequency (using the numbers from the paper gives sum @9.95 MHz, difference @50 kHz).

An interesting part is the transducer which is used. This is a confocal transducer which has two individual transducers on it in the shape of concentric circles. The two transducers transmit the two frequencies, but it is only in the focus of the transducer that the two will overlap.},

The main assumptions are not valid for my work. They are: wavelength (1) << mean free path between scattering events (2) << total path (3). In the mm-wave case it would probably be more like (1) \approx (2) < (3).

They assume movement due to ultrasound in a very direct manner. This might be the case for very small scatterers since an acoustic wave is nothing more than a mechanical movement. However, this does not hold for larger objects. Instead, one would have to look at acoustic radiation forcing in that case which is not an as direct effect.},

Spectroscopy can be used to measure blood volume and blood oxygen, but because most biological tissues are highly scattering at optical wavelengths, spatial resolution is poor. Ultrasound provides excellent resolution, but not good soft-tissue contrast. There are many techniques for combining light and ultrasound, but the two discussed in this paper have emerged as having the most promise for medical applications. In the first, optoacoustic imaging, an acoustic pulse is generated by a pulse of laser light, and the detected sound is used to produce an image. In the second, acousto-photonic imaging, ultrasound modulates laser light used for diffusive optical tomography. Both of these techniques show promise for a variety of medical applications.},

A calculation of the modulation signal predicts the possibility of tomographic imaging, which is confirmed experimentally.},
  comment       = {Similar to the reasoning in Leutz1995 when it comes to how an ultrasonic wave affects light.

The main effect that is shown here has its foundation in a phase being the function of distances between different scatterers. An acoustic wave displaces scatterers in its beam, and this alters the phase. They then use different correlation functions to come to a conclusion of the final signal. Still, the result is a modulation by the acoustic frequency (and harmonics), so a very similar result of the interaction when compared to other mechanisms (which do not rely on the same fundamental interaction).

The main issue when looking at the problem at hand is if it's even possible to consider these phase changes due to displacements. The displacement of scatterers is bound to not work in the same way for larger scatterers (think mm-size instead of molecular size), but they should still be displaced due to acoustic radiation force. But the results from all papers on UOT or similar methods are based on dynamic multiple scattering of the light, which might not be valid for the mm-wave imaging problem. When reading Helander2017 there is a basic assumption of sparse scatterers, which clearly should not require theory based on a large numbers of scattering events as in DMLS.},

As Marshall1972, this mentions focusing due to acoustic spherical waves (I think the point is that they act as a spherical reflector when electromagnetic waves are scattered). This might be a key to understanding how they get an acceptable SNR even though the theory in Saleh2007 indicates that longer EM wavelengths should be very difficult to detect.

There is a discussion on acoustic and electromagnetic pulse lengths and their impact on the frequency shift. Since a CW acoustic wave only has one frequency the shift will be there regardless of the Bragg condition. However, for a short pulse the spectrum contains many frequencies and the Bragg frequency will correspond to the largest interaction and also the largest shift. There are also cases in between these two for longer pulses. FMCW acoustic sweep is also discussed as a way of guaranteeing Bragg matching at all altitudes even when temperature changes with altitude (and this is at different frequencies which allows for easy temperature measuring from the frequency, which is the point of RASS).},

They don't delve into very much theoretical derivation, but still present some good points. There are also references to other works with more theoretical backgound.

The interaction in RASS works by transmitting acoustic and electromagnetic waves in the same direction from the same point. This corresponds to theta=pi/2 using the notation from Saleh2007. In that case the Bragg condition for maximum reflection is lambda_a = lambda_e/2 (which is written in the paper). They describe a usage of spherical acoustic and electromagnetic waves with a common origin, which should focus the scattered electromagnetic waves back to the origin. This might be the reason why they show an equation for received power which is quite different from the equation for reflectance shown in Saleh2007.

The derivation can a bit hard to follow since all variables are not described very well. Contains a lengthy derivation of the spectrum of scattered electromagnetic waves. This is interesting if the acoustic and electromagnetic pulses are not infinite. There is also a power budget which is of great interest since this is one of the larger questions when it comes to interaction due to density variation. Might need to read this more to understand it fully, but one important conclusion is the direct relation between the received power and the square of the number of acoustic wavelengths in an acoustic pulse. Assuming CW EM waves, the number of acoustic wavelengths in a pulse is a parameter directly determining the interaction length. The focusing from sperical acoustic wavefronts is also included in the derivation, which leads to a r^(-2) decay instead of a r^(-4) one in regular radar. This is of great importance in RASS, but maybe not in NDT since the distances are so much smaller. If the only effect of the spherical wavefront focusing is a slower distance decay, it might be possible to use other acoustic beam shapes in NDT.},

The first part of the paper describes the interaction between acoustic and electromagnetic waves without wind which is interesting. The later part with wind is not as useful for my work. The first part might prove to be very useful since it is a derivation leading to the same Bragg condition seen elsewhere, but this derivation is easy to understand when compared to many others.},

  abstract      = {We present the theory of radio-acoustic sounding (RAS) of the atmosphere allowing for the dependence on temperature, altitude, and wind. For the case of a linear temperature profile, we obtained expressions for the received signal power. Since the acoustic wave front differs from the sphere if the temperature gradient is allowed for, we can introduce the notion of projector (Fresnel) and Fraunhofer regions. In the Fresnel region, the size of the diffraction spot on the earth is determined by radar antenna dimensions and the received signal power is proportional to z‚àí2. In the Fraunhofer region, the spot size is greater than the antenna dimensions and the power is proportional to z‚àí6. The existing RAS facilities work in the projector region. This can be used as a basis for developing a new method of diagnostics of a large-scale inhomogeneous atmospheric structure, including wave disturbances.},
  comment       = {Contains a derivation similar to Gurvich1987 but also considers wind. Wind is not of any concern to me, but at least this paper was scanned better than Gurvich1987 and the formulas are not half-invisible.

The very start of the derivation has a definition of permittivity which is only true in air. It is that the relative permittivity is "epsilon = 1 + epsilon1" where epsilon1 is a small perturbation. Air has relative permittivity ~1, but for other values of relative permittivity (let's call it er) the relation should be "epsilon = er + epsilon1". I need to analyze what would happen to the rest of the results if a change like this is introduced.

There is a pretty nice equation for the received power (analogous to the radar equation), although it contains a bunch of stuff related to wind. If I read the paper well enough I should be able to understand which variables are important and which are negligible. The size of both the acoustic and EM antennas seem to be important (relating to the beamwidth obviously). In the "radar equation" there is an exponential with a bunch of rho's and a vind velocity integral. I'm fairly sure this entire exponential is equal to one without wind and in a homogeneous material. If that is the case the equation is even more like a radar equation.},

What is of great interest is chapter 4 (the formal approach). This is where derivations are done in a more electromagnetic fashion. In particular, section 4.2.7 (polarization) starts at Maxwell's equations to later arrive at conclusions regarding the electromagnetic wave equation (4.158) which is very similar to the one used in Rapoport1997 (though this reference has a better equation since any material can be used). However, there are some arguments regarding polarization (p. 135 at bottom) used in the derivation which may or may not be fulfilled for the angles and/or planes of incidence used in my application. These need to be kept in mind! Also, there is a scattering integral (4.152) which might be useful in calculating the scattered field directly if applicable (it is subject to the same polarization arguments). In the book, both of these equations are then reverted to equations derived earlier in the text under other assumptions (as a way of showing that the theory described before actually works even when deriving from first principles). It might be good to also look at those earlier stages, even though this first principle derivation is very nice.},

Much of the book is on completely unrelated things, but chapter 2 has a nice derivation on how a dielectric perturbation affects an electromagnetic wave. This is done from first principles (Maxwell) and reaches a scattering integral without too many assumptions and in a clear manner. The same derivation was redone by me with some of the assumptions changed for more relevant ones. The derivation continues into a section on power density, but when it comes to power there are better thigs to find in Gurvich1987 than here. After this it gets more irrelevant for me. But the derivation into a scattering integral is really good, and it is in good agreement with those in Gurvich1987 and Korpel1988. My own derivation clears up questions if parameters such as wavenumber and speed of light are in material or in vacuum, which is really good.
