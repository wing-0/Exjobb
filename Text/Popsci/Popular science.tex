		\textbf{
			In the aerospace industry new materials are continuously being developed for their promise in being lighter, stronger and overall better. At the same time it is very important that those materials are reliable since they go into parts which keep the aircraft flying. Because of this, methods for inspecting parts for defects without bad effects on the parts themselves are used. One possible way of improving such methods is to combine two existing methods which use ultrasound and microwaves.
		}
		
		\noindent
		Non-destructive testing (NDT) is a group of methods used to detect flaws in materials. In the aerospace industry these kinds of methods have always been used, but more recently their significance has increased. This is due to the use of composite materials in modern aircraft. These types of materials have great advantages over traditional aluminum in many aspects, but they need to be monitored more closely for flaws and damage. Among others, ultrasound and microwaves are used for NDT of composite structures.
