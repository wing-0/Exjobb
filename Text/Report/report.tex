	\section{Nondestructive Testing Techniques}
	Nondestructive testing has been ... In industries with high demands for quality and safety, NDT is often a necessity. Aerospace is such an industry and has utilized NDT for a long time. \todo{citation needed} Modern aircraft increasingly use composite materials due to superior properties such as low weight \cite{Katunin2015}. The difference of these materials when compared with traditional metal structures requires changes in the NDT procedures \cite{Riegert2006}. One old technique which is used widely for aerospace composites is ultrasonic testing \cite{Garnier2011}. Another technique which has been developed more recently than ultrasonic testing is microwave/mm-wave imaging, which may hold promises in various NDT applications \cite{Kharkovsky2007}.

	\section{Acousto-EM in Established Technology}
	Interaction between acoustics and electromagnetism has been known of for a long time \todo{citation needed}. Beyond knowledge of the phenomena there are also applications in technology which are investigated in this section. Two examples are given: acousto-optics and the Radio Acoustic Sounding System. These operate at very different frequencies (both acoustic and electromagnetic) which can be of interest when investigating the possibility of using mm-wave frequencies.
	
	\subsection{Acousto-Optics}
	
	\subsection{Radio Acoustic Sounding System}
	One application of acousto-electromagnetic interaction can be found in meteorology through the Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS). The purpose of the system is to utilize the interaction between radio and acoustic waves for temperature sounding of the atmosphere \todo{Find some nice review article or something}.
	This mechanism has not only been used in optics, but also in radio meteorology through the Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) \cite{Buerkle2007}. This indicates that the wavelength dependence described above can be offset by other factors to still give a measurable scattered signal. The system is used for temperature sounding since the speed of sound depends on temperature. The Bragg scattering condition is thus affected by a temperature change \cite{Marshall1972}. The systems are usually designed with electromagnetic and acoustic wave sources approximately co-located \cite{Marshall1972}. This corresponds to an angle $\theta \approx 90^\circ$, which changes the Bragg condition to
	\begin{equation*}
	\Lambda = \frac{\lambda}{2}
	\end{equation*}

	\section{Overview of Interaction Mechanisms}
	
	\subsection{Target Boundary Perturbation}
	This mechanism is based on a discrete target under acoustic resonance. The resonance of the target leads to vibration, which is seen as a time-dependent boundary perturbation \cite{Buerkle2007}. This is seen in the scattered signal as a frequency shift by the vibration frequency \cite{Sarabandi2003}. \todo{More details on the Radlab stuff}
	
	The frequency shift mentioned earlier is due to the micro-Doppler effect, which describes effects of targets with rotation or vibration \cite{Buerkle2007}. A vibrating target then causes frequency modulation of the scattered electromagnetic wave. \cite{Chen2006}. For a stationary target this corresponds to a signal with a strong frequency component at $f_c$ and weaker sidebands at $f_c \pm n f_v$ where $n=1$ are the strongest (carrier frequency $f_c$, variation frequency $f_v$, positive integers $n$). The amplitudes of the spectral lines are given by Bessel functions $J_n(B)$, where $B \sim (4\pi/\lambda)D_v$ \cite{Chen2006}. $D_v$ is the amplitude of vibration which is usually small (on the order of $\mu$m) \cite{Buerkle2007}\cite{Top2014}. For small values of $B$ the central component will dominate, and the first Doppler component will be much more prominent than the others. Therefore it makes sense that this first component is the one considered in the literature \cite{Buerkle2007}.
	
	\subsection{Localized Harmonic Motion}
	This mechanism is similar to boundary perturbation in that it is based on scattering from harmonic motion. The difference is that harmonic motion is introduced in a bulk material instead of a resonating discrete target. The mechanism has been utilized in the medical method of vibro-acoustography and harmonic motion imaging \cite{Wang2018}. Both techniques use amplitude modulated ultrasound to produce a time-harmonic acoustic radiation force in a localized region of a sample. This force then generates time-harmonic displacement, or vibration. In the acoustic methods the vibrating region emits acoustic waves which can be detected \cite{Fatemi1998}\cite{Konofagou2003}.
	
	An electromagnetic wave incident towards the vibrating region will scatter with a frequency shift which corresponds to the frequency of vibration \cite{Top2014}. This is very similar to the boundary perturbation mechanism described before.
	
	One detail omitted before is the two methods of generating radiation force locally. The first method uses amplitude modulated focused ultrasound with its focus on the region of interest \cite{Top2016}. Since amplitude modulated ultrasound exists throughout the beam a force is generated in that entire region. However, the intensity is much higher in the focus so the force is stronger there. The second method instead uses two single-frequency ultrasonic beams which intersect at the region of interest. The frequencies of the two beams differ by a small amount $\Delta \Omega$. Superposition at the intersection will then generate localized amplitude modulation by half the difference frequency $\Delta \Omega/2$. However, the acoustic radiation force is determined by the energy density of the wave. This is proportional to the square of the acoustic field, which changes the frequency of interest by a factor 2. The frequency of the acoustic radiation force is then the difference frequency $\Delta \Omega$ \cite{Fatemi1998}.
	
	\subsection{Acousto-Optics}\todo{fix this stuff - lots of "old" stuff that isn't very nice to present here. I know much more than when I wrote this...}
	This mechanism is the one used in the theory of acousto-optics \cite{Saleh2007}\cite{Korpel1981}. The main idea is that there is a relation between the strain in a material and its index of refraction. Since an acoustic wave consists of periodic compression and rarefaction in a medium (which can be related to strain), a consequence is that the index of refraction varies with the same period \cite{Saleh2007}. Due to Fresnel reflection, this periodic structure of varying index of refraction acts as a Bragg reflector scattering incident light. The Bragg condition determines the angle of incidence $\theta_B$ required for the light
	\begin{equation*}
	\sin{\theta_B} = \frac{\lambda}{2\Lambda}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\lambda$ is the light wavelength and $\Lambda$ is the acoustic wavelength \cite{Saleh2007}.
	
	There is nothing in the basic theory suggesting that optical frequencies are required for this interaction. At microwave frequencies premittivity is more common to use than index of refraction, but they are related and the principle is the same. An application which uses this principle and has been used for many years is the radio acoustic sounding system \cite{Buerkle2007}. Additionally, though not using the exact Bragg formulation for modeling interaction, some authors have explored other ways of using similar interaction at microwave frequencies \cite{Lawrence2001}\cite{Merkel2006}. It has been stated, however, that this interaction is very small and resonance is often required (giving rise to boundary perturbation) \cite{Buerkle2007}. This can be understood by looking at the acousto-optic theory. The Bragg condition gives the angle for peak reflectance against the acoustic wave. When considering strength of the interaction, though, an actual value for the reflectance is of interest. This can be found as
	%	\begin{equation*}
	%		\mathcal{R} = \frac{\pi^2}{2\lambda_0^2} \left( \frac{L}{\sin{\theta}} \right) ^2 \mathcal{M}I_s
	%	\end{equation*}
	%	where $\lambda_0$ is vacuum light wavelength, $L/\sin{\theta}$ is the oblique distance of light penetration (approximately), $\mathcal{M}$ is a material parameter and $I_s$ is the acoustic intensity \cite{Saleh2007}. Alternatively, the Bragg condition can be used for the equation
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{R} = 2\pi^2n^2 \frac{L^2 \Lambda^2}{\lambda_0^4} \mathcal{M}I_s
	\end{equation*} \todo{Refine this segment on reflectance and stuff, it's not very coherent}
	where $n$ is the unperturbed index of refraction, $L$ is the distance of overlap between light and acoustic waves in the acoustic wave direction, $\Lambda$ is the acoustic wavelength, $\lambda_0$ is the vacuum light wavelength, $\mathcal{M}$ is a material parameter and $I_s$ is the acoustic intensity \cite{Saleh2007}. For intense acoustic waves a correction is necessary, giving $\mathcal{R}_e = \sin{^2\sqrt{\mathcal{R}}}$ \cite{Saleh2007}.
	
	The interesting part when it comes to microwave frequencies, however, is the denominator in the first equation. The factor $1/\lambda_0^4$ might be a reason of concern when moving away from the optical regime. Since the wavelength is much longer for mm-waves there should be a large decrease in reflectance, and if too large the scattered signal could be undetectable. However, some examples for optical wavelengths give $\mathcal{R}_e = 0.192$ \cite{Saleh2007}, which is very large when compared with what can be detected in radar \cite{Richards2012}. There are also other variables such as $L$ and $\Lambda$ which might be changed to give a higher reflectance. If the different parameters can be selected to give a scattered signal above the noise floor is a very interesting question which needs to be investigated.
	
	\subsubsection{Radio Acoustic Sounding} \todo{Maybe move this part somewhere else? Yes, but not everything}
	This mechanism has not only been used in optics, but also in radio meteorology through the Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS) \cite{Buerkle2007}. This indicates that the wavelength dependence described above can be offset by other factors to still give a measurable scattered signal. The system is used for temperature sounding since the speed of sound depends on temperature. The Bragg scattering condition is thus affected by a temperature change \cite{Marshall1972}. The systems are usually designed with electromagnetic and acoustic wave sources approximately co-located \cite{Marshall1972}. This corresponds to an angle $\theta \approx 90^\circ$, which changes the Bragg condition to
	\begin{equation*}
	\Lambda = \frac{\lambda}{2}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Scatterer Displacement}
	This is a mechanism mostly presented in the field of ultrasound-optical tomography (UOT). The mechanism is based on dynamic multiple scattering of light, which occurs if many scatterers undergoing Brownian motion are considered \cite{Leutz1995}. If an ultrasonic beam is incident on such a sample the scatterers will move due to both Brownian motion and ultrasound, giving rise to a frequency shift in affected photons \cite{Leutz1995}\cite{Elson2011}. In medical applications, movement of the scatterers due to acoustic waves is very straight-forward: their displacement directly follows the acoustic wave \cite{Leutz1995}. This might well be the case for small scatterers which are then part of the wave, but for larger scatterers it gets more complicated. In that case, acoustic radiation force has to be considered for scatterer movement \cite{Torr1984}. \todo{Double check some things on movement of small vs. big scatterers}
	
	It is interesting to see if this mechanism holds any relevance when it comes to microwave frequencies. The assumption on which the theory rests is that of dynamic multiple light scattering \cite{Leutz1995}. In the existing mm-wave imaging system there is an assumption of sparse defects being the only scatterers \cite{Helander2017}. This is in complete contrast to the theory of dynamic multiple light scattering, which is based on a large number of moving scatterers \cite{Leutz1995}. Since the basic assumptions of the problem and theory are in such stark contrast, it seems likely that this interaction mechanism holds little relevance to the problem at hand.
	
	\section{Ultrasonic Propagation}
	\todo[inline]{See if what's written below works as is or needs editing. It's just copy-pasted from the review doc. Probably need to add even more info than this as well}
	
	\subsection{Background stuff on ultrasound}
	This subject is of interest to both phenomena of localized harmonic motion and photoelastic interaction. Since ultrasound is used for some type of interaction with electromagnetic waves, it is important to understand that part of the problem. In many NDT applications the ultrasonic waves are generated in some transducer, coupled into a fluid medium and then coupled further into the solid medium of the test object \cite{Schmerr2016}. This requires knowledge of wave propagation in both fluid and solid media, which requires two different approaches: acoustics and elastodynamics.	
	
	\subsection{Propagation in fluid medium - acoustic waves}
	In a compressible fluid ultrasound can be described by a fully acoustic model. The main variable for describing the wave motion is pressure in this case. In turn, this can be converted into other variables such as displacement or strain. The acoustic wave equation which describes the phenomena is
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2 p - \frac{1}{c_f^2} \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial t^2} + f = 0
	\end{equation*}
	where $p$ is pressure, $c_f$ is the speed of sound in the fluid and $f$ is a scalar body force \cite{Schmerr2016}. The speed of sound can be written as $c_f = \sqrt{K/\rho_0}$ where $K$ is the bulk modulus of the fluid and $\rho_0$ is the unperturbed density of the fluid \cite{Kaufman2000}. The scalar body force is related to a vector body force dy the divergence: $f = -\nabla \cdot \bm{f}$ \cite{Schmerr2016}.
	
	This model is directly useful for NDT in some cases. One is in immersion testing, where a test object is immersed in water and ultrasound propagates through the water into the object \cite{Schmerr2016}. The other is in coupling ultrasound from a transducer to an object through a thin layer of coupling fluid \cite{Schmerr2016}. However, this model is also useful for understanding one special case of propagation in an elastic solid. This will be described in the following part.
	
	\subsection{Propagation in solid medium - elastic waves}
	In an elastic medium the acoustic model is no longer sufficient. The acoustic model considers only pressure since one main assumption for volume elements in the fluid is that they only transmit force in the direction of the force \cite{Kaufman2000}. The volume elements in an elastic solid are more strongly coupled to each other, and this assumption does not hold anymore \cite{Kaufman2005}. The equations for elastic waves are instead based on solid mechanics. There is no simple wave equation as in acoustics, instead the complete model is described by Navier's equations
	\begin{equation*}
	\mu \nabla^2 \bm{u} + (\lambda+\mu) \nabla (\nabla \cdot \bm{u}) + \bm{f} = \rho_0 \frac{\partial^2 \bm{u}}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\bm{u}$ is the displacement vector and $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Lamé parameters of the material \cite{Schmerr2016}. To obtain wave equations from this, a Helmholtz decomposition is made as
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{u} = \nabla \phi + \nabla \times \bm{\psi}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\phi$ is a scalar potential and $\bm{\psi}$ is a vector potential \cite{Schmerr2016}. For Navier's equations to be fulfilled, the following must hold for the potentials \cite{Schmerr2016}:
	\begin{align*}
	&\nabla^2 \phi - \frac{1}{c_p^2} \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = 0 \\
	&\nabla^2 \bm{\psi} - \frac{1}{c_s^2} \frac{\partial^2 \bm{\psi}}{\partial t^2} = 0
	\end{align*}
	These are two wave equations with the wave speeds \cite{Schmerr2016}
	\begin{align*}
	c_p &= \sqrt{(\lambda + 2\mu)/\rho_0} \\
	c_s &= \sqrt{\mu/\rho_0}
	\end{align*}
	By further investigation, the waves can be identified as p-waves with speed $c_p$ and s-waves with speed $c_s$ \cite{Schmerr2016}. The p-waves are very similar to acoustic waves, and it can be shown that the dilatation of the solid follows the p-wave equation \cite{Schmerr2016}. The s-waves on the other hand, do not have an analogy in acoustics. The rotation of the solid follows the s-wave equation \cite{Schmerr2016}, and as discussed before this type of motion does not propagate in a compressible fluid. When it comes to actually generating ultrasonic elastic waves, transducers are available both for generation of p-waves and s-waves \cite{Schmerr2016}. A simple model for determining strain is then based on calculating only one potential and setting the other to zero. This is common when working with p-waves \cite{Kaufman2000}.
	
	The elastic waves described above are called bulk waves since they are only fully describe waves in the bulk of an elastic solid \cite{Kaufman2005}. Other wave phenomena exist such as surface waves (Rayleigh, Stoneley, Love) \cite{Kaufman2005} and plate waves (SH, Lamb) \cite{Schmerr2016}. These waves are not insignificant and are used in some branches of ultrasonic testing \cite{Schmerr2016}. However, only bulk waves are considered here and then mostly p-waves.

	\section{Photoelastic Interaction}
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	\todo[inline]{Explain clearly that this is acousto-optics, but derived directly from Maxwell and without the word "optics" in the name}
	
	\subsection{Photoelasticity}
	To understand how the interaction between the two wave phenomena works, the first step is to understand how an acoustic or elastic wave affects electromagnetic properties. The theory of photoelasticity relates strains from linear elasticity with the relative permittivity of a material. With a starting point in solid mechanics, a tensor-based theory is somewhat inevitable. However, a simplified model is shown later which condenses the tensor relations down to a scalar relation.
	\todo[inline]{Theory describing relation between solid (continuum?) mechanics and dielectric properties}
	
	A starting point can be found in the literature on acousto-optics in the relation \cite{Korpel1988}
	\begin{equation*}
	\Delta \left( \frac{1}{n_i^2} \right) = p_{ij} S_j
	\end{equation*}
	where $S_j$ are strains and $i,j = 1,...,6$. The double indexation of $j$ in both $p$ and $S$ indicates a summation over $j$. This can seem a bit troublesome to use since the LHS is the difference of an inverse quantity. This can be rewritten as shown below
	\begin{align*}
	\alpha &= \frac{1}{n_i^2},\ n_i = \alpha^{-1/2} \\
	\Delta n_i &= \frac{\mathrm{d}n_i}{\mathrm{d}\alpha} \Delta \alpha = -\frac{1}{2} \alpha^{-3/2} \Delta \alpha = -\frac{1}{2} n_i^3 p_{ij} S_j
	\end{align*}
	The refractive index and relative permittivity are related by $\varepsilon_{r_i} = n_i^2$ in a non-magnetic material. To obtain the change in relative permittivity instead of refractive index
	\begin{equation*}
	\Delta \varepsilon_{r_i} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\varepsilon_{r_i}}{\mathrm{d}n_i} \Delta n_i = 2n_i \Delta n_i = -n_i^4 p_{ij} S_j = -\varepsilon_{r_i}^2 p_{ij} S_j
	\end{equation*}
	
	The tensor notation used above is a simplified form described by the 1949 IRE standards. The relation to full tensor notation is shown below for an arbitrary tensor $a$ \cite{Korpel1988}
	\begin{align*}
	a_1 &= n_{11},\ a_2 = a_{22},\ a_3 = a_{33}, \\
	a_4 &= a_{23},\ a_5 = a_{31},\ a_6 = a_{12}
	\end{align*}
	If the strains are considered, it is clear that indices 1-3 are tensile and 4-6 are shear. For the photoelastic tensor it can be seen that it is of rank 4, being $p_{ijkl}$ in standard notation. One thing to note is that the 4 indices in standard notation should allow for many more components of the photoelastic tensor than those possible using this compact notation (81 instead of 36). This is due to symmetry of the photoelastic tensor in this particular model. \todo{Citation needed} It should also be noted that this model does break down in some cases, and more advanced descriptions of the phenomena exist \cite{Nelson1971}. However, this model was considered advanced enough as a starting point for this problem, especially since it is quite heavily simplified in the end.
	
	This model of the photoelastic tensor allows for up to 36 independent components, but for the simple case of an isotropic solid the tensor simplifies to \cite{Korpel1988}
	\begin{align*}
	p_{11} &= p_{22} = p_{33}, \ p_{12} = p_{21} = p_{13} = p_{23} = p_{32}\\
	p_{44} &= p_{55} = p_{66} = \frac{1}{2} (p_{11} - p_{12}), \ p_{ij} = 0 \text{ for others}
	\end{align*}
	\todo[inline]{Continue editing and adaptation of the section after this}
	
	The simplest material to consider would be an isotropic solid with isotropic permittivity $\varepsilon_r$. There is then no preferred axis and a coordinate system can be selected arbitrarily. A longitudinal acoustic wave is defined by \begin{equation*}
	S_1(x_1,t) = \delta_{11}(x_1,t) = S_0 \cos(\Omega t - qx_1)
	\end{equation*}
	It is propagating in the $x_1$ direction and is thus a strain $S_1$, and all other strains are assumed to be zero. The relation $\Delta \varepsilon_{r_i} = -\varepsilon_{r_i}^2 p_{ij} S_j$ together with the photoelastic tensor for isotropic solids then gives
	\begin{align*}
	\varepsilon_{r_1} &= -\varepsilon_r^2 p_{11} S_0 \cos(\Omega t - qx_1) \\
	\varepsilon_{r_2} &= \varepsilon_{r_3} = -\varepsilon_r^2 p_{12} S_0 \cos(\Omega t - qx_1)
	\end{align*}
	It is clear that the permittivity now has an axis $x_1$ where it has another value than in $x_2$ and $x_3$. So even for a material which is nominally completely isotropic, a preferred axis arises for the permittivity! This type of anisotropy is called birefringence in optics, and in this case it is caused by dipoles aligning themselves parallel to the strain \cite{Korpel1988}. Practically, the effect of this is that the interaction strength of this mechanism depends on the EM polarization with respect to the acoustic wave polarization. In longitudinal acoustic waves the polarization and propagation direction coincide, which makes analysis easier.
	
	Another starting point for the interaction is the Lorentz-Lorenz relation, which leads to the equations \cite{Korpel1988}
	\begin{align*}
	\Delta n &= C' s \\
	C' &= \left[ \frac{(n^2-1)(n^2+2)}{6n} \right](1-\Lambda_0) \\
	\Lambda_0 &= -\left( \frac{\rho}{\alpha} \right) \frac{\mathrm{d} \alpha}{\mathrm{d} \rho}
	\end{align*}
	where $\rho$ is the density and $\alpha$ is the molecular polarizability. Here the anisotropic effects are contained in the parameter $\Lambda_0$ \cite{Korpel1988}. If anisotropy should be considered, the tensor model is probably better to use, but if $\Lambda_0$ is neglected a simplified model is obtained. This type of model is usually accurate for liquids, but many solids do not have this behavior \cite{Korpel1988}. Nevertheless, the simplified relation can be written for permittivity (using $\varepsilon_r = n^2$ and $\Delta \varepsilon_r = 2n \Delta n$) as
	\begin{equation*}
	\Delta \varepsilon_r = \frac{1}{3} (\varepsilon_r - 1)(\varepsilon_r + 2) s
	\end{equation*}
	This can be compared with the previous relation $\Delta \varepsilon_r = -\mathfrak{p}\varepsilon_r^2 s$ to obtain an equivalent photoelasticity
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathfrak{p} = -\frac{(\varepsilon_r - 1)(\varepsilon_r + 2)}{3\varepsilon_r^2}
	\end{equation*}
	This can then be used in all equations derived with $\mathfrak{p}$ relating permittivity and strain. A plot of $\mathfrak{p}$ as a function of $\varepsilon_r$ is shown in figure \ref{fig:photoelastic-liquid}. It can be seen clearly that the interaction strength increases with $\varepsilon_r$ close to 1. However, at around $\varepsilon_r = 4$ an extreme is reached, and further on $\mathfrak{p}$ planes out. Thus, there is a bound on the interaction strength for this relation. It should be noted that this model is extremely simplistic and will probably give faulty results in many cases. \todo{Maybe write about the figure more in detail}

	\section{Scattering in a perturbed dielectric \label{sec:analytical-scatter}}
	Scattering of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric perturbation is now considered in general. A full derivation can be found in \ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter}, but the main steps are shown here as well. Much of the derivation follows one in \cite{Tatarskii1971}. The starting point is Maxwell's equations for a linear, non-magnetic, source-free, isotropic dielectric. Note that the permittivity is not homogeneous.
	\begin{align*}
	&\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{E}} = -\mu_0 \frac{\partial \bm{\mathcal{H}}}{\partial t} \\
	&\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{H}} = \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{\mathcal{E}})}{\partial t} \\
	&\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{\mathcal{E}}) = 0 \\
	&\nabla \cdot \bm{\mathcal{H}} = 0
	\end{align*}
	The script letters are used here to indicate a time dependence as
	\begin{align*}
	&\bm{\mathcal{E}}(\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}(\bm{r},t) \text{e}^{-i\omega t} \\
	&\bm{\mathcal{H}}(\bm{r},t) = \bm{H}(\bm{r},t) \text{e}^{-i\omega t}
	\end{align*}
	This is used to remove the e$^{-i\omega t}$ dependence in the equations and only keep "slower" time dependencies. The new equations are
	\begin{align*}
	&\nabla \times \bm{E} = i\omega \mu_0 \bm{H} - \mu_0 \frac{\partial \bm{H}}{\partial t} \\
	&\nabla \times \bm{H} = -i\omega \varepsilon \bm{E} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} \\
	&\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{E}) = 0 \\
	&\nabla \cdot \bm{H} = 0
	\end{align*}
	Now $\nabla \times$ is applied to $\nabla \times \bm{E}$ and it is combined with $\nabla \times \bm{H}$, giving
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla \times (\nabla \times \bm{E}) = \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} + 2i\omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	The relation $\nabla \times (\nabla \times \bm{E}) = -\nabla^2\bm{E} + \nabla(\nabla \cdot \bm{E})$ is now used
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \bm{E}) - 2i\omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Gauss' law $\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{E}) = 0$ is now expanded to $\varepsilon(\nabla \cdot \bm{E}) + (\nabla \varepsilon) \cdot \bm{E} = 0$. This can be rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla \cdot \bm{E} = -\bm{E} \cdot \frac{\nabla \varepsilon}{\varepsilon} = -\bm{E} \cdot \nabla (\ln{\varepsilon})
	\end{equation*}
	Inserting this into the previous equation gives
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} = -\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla (\ln{\varepsilon})) - 2i\omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Now, the dielectric perturbation is defined as
	\begin{equation*}
	\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0(\varepsilon_r + \varepsilon_1)
	\end{equation*}
	where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\varepsilon_r$ is the unperturbed value for relative permittivity in the material and $\varepsilon_1$ is a small perturbation around $\varepsilon_r$. For $|\varepsilon_1| \ll \varepsilon_r$ $\ln{\varepsilon}$ can be approximated as
	\begin{equation*}
	\ln{\varepsilon} = \ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r) + \ln(1 + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r}) \approx \ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r) + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r}
	\end{equation*}
	Since $\ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r)$ is constant, the gradient can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla(\ln{\varepsilon}) = \nabla \left( \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r} \right) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_r} \nabla \varepsilon_1
	\end{equation*}
	This is now inserted in the equation for the electric field together with the definition of the perturbation:
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \bm{E} = \\
	-\omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_1 \bm{E} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - 2i\omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Now $k$ is defined as $k = \omega/c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in the material
	\begin{equation*}
	c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r}} = \frac{c_0}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}}
	\end{equation*}
	The equation for $\bm{E}$ is written as
	\begin{equation*}
		\nabla^2\bm{E} + k^2 \bm{E} = \\
		-k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r} \bm{E} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - \frac{2ik}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}

	The electric field is split up into an incident field $\bm{E}_i$ and a scattered field $\bm{E}_{sc}$ such that $\bm{E} = \bm{E}_i + \bm{E}_{sc}$. The scattered field is considered to be small compared to the incident field (Born approximation). The incident field then approximately obeys the source-free equation
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2 \bm{E}_{i} + k^2 \bm{E}_{i} = 0
	\end{equation*}
	If this is subtracted from the total equation and $\bm{E}_{sc}$ is neglected in the RHS the resulting equation is
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2\bm{E}_{sc} + k^2 \bm{E}_{sc} =	-k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r} \bm{E}_i -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}\nabla(\bm{E}_i \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - \frac{2ik}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E}_i)}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E}_i)}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Furthermore, some terms can be neglected if the condition $v/c \ll |\varepsilon_1|/\varepsilon_r$ holds. If this is used together with a Sommerfeld radiation condition, the solution is
	\begin{equation*}
	\boxed{
		\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_r} \int_{V_{sc}} \frac{e^{ik |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \left( k^2 \bm{E}_i (\bm{r'},t) \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t) + \nabla (\bm{E}_i (\bm{r'},t) \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t)) \right) \mathrm{d}v'
	}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\section{Radar equation for simple photoelastic interaction \label{sec:analytical-radar}}
	The scattering integral is now solved for a simple geometry and material model to obtain a radar equation. A full derivation can be found in \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar} while some parts have been shortened here for readability. First, the geometry is defined as shown in figure \ref{fig:radareq-geom-main}.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\input{scatteringgeom.tikz}
		\caption{\label{fig:radareq-geom-main} Geometry for the scattering problem.}
	\end{figure}
	The $xy$-plane is defined as the plane formed by the acoustic and electromagnetic wavevectors (they are assumed to be non-parallel). The scattering volume is a cuboid with dimensions $L_x$, $L_y$ and $L_z$. It is centered in the origin of the coordinate system, and both the acoustic and electromagnetic waves are approximated as plane waves close to the origin. Thus, the electromagnetic and dielectric perturbation fields near the origin are defined as
	\begin{align*}
	\bm{E}_i (\bm{r}',t) &= \bm{E}_i (\bm{r}') = \bm{E}_{i0} e^{i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}'} \\
	\varepsilon_1 (\bm{r}',t) &= -\mathfrak{p} \varepsilon_r^2 S_0 \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t)
	\end{align*}
	Here, $\bm{E}_{i0}$ is the complex field amplitude at the origin ($-i\omega t$ time-dependence separated) and $\bm{k}$ is the electromagnetic wavevector. A scalar photoelastic relation has been assumed, where $\mathfrak{p}$ is the photoelastic constant, $S_0$ is the acoustic strain amplitude at the origin, $\bm{q}$ is the acoustic wavevector and $\Omega$ the acoustic frequency.
	
	For simplicity, the electromagnetic polarization is assumed to be in z, $\bm{E}_{i0} \parallel \bm{\hat{z}}$. This is also in part done to avoid polarization changes in the scattered field \cite{Korpel1988}. Due to this $\nabla(\bm{E}_i \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) = \bm{0}$ which simplifies the scattering integral to
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{k^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_r} \int_{V_{sc}} \frac{e^{ik |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \bm{E}_i (\bm{r'},t) \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{equation*}
	The field expressions are now inserted, and with a far-field approximation and expansion of the cosine as complex exponentials the integral is written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = -\frac{\varepsilon_rk^2 e^{ikr}}{8\pi r} \bm{E}_{i0} \mathfrak{p} S_0 \left( e^{-i\Omega t} \int_{V_{sc}} e^{i( k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) + \bm{q} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v + e^{i\Omega t} \int_{V_{sc}} e^{i( k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) - \bm{q} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' \right)
	\end{equation*}
	The solution to this integral is written as (see \ref{sec:app-derivations-radar})
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc} (\bm{r},t) = -\bm{E}_{i0} \left( E_A^+ (\bm{r},t) + E_A^- (\bm{r},t) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
	E_A^\pm (\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_rk^2 e^{ikr}}{8\pi r} \mathfrak{p} S_0 L_x L_y L_z e^{\mp i\Omega t} \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{equation*}
	and
	\begin{multline*}
	\Phi^\pm(\theta,\phi) = \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_x}{2\pi} \left( k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} \right) \right) 
	\cdot \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_y}{2\pi} \left( -k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} \right) \right) \\
	\cdot \text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_z}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right)
	\end{multline*}
	One important detail to note is that two distinct frequency components arise: one where the frequency is shifted up by $\Omega$ ($E_A^+$) and one where it is shifted down by $\Omega$ ($E_A^-$).
	
	To obtain a more practical expression, the equations are now transformed into power. The scattered power density is given by
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{S}_{sc} = \frac{1}{2} \bm{E}_{sc} \times \bm{H}_{sc}^*
	\end{equation*}
	with the magnetic field $\bm{H}_{sc}$ given by
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{H}_{sc} \approx \frac{1}{ik \eta_0 \eta} \nabla \times \bm{E}_{sc}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\eta_0$ is the wave impedance of free space and $\eta_0 \eta$ the wave impedance in the material. The scattered electric field is inserted, and in the far-field the power density can then be calculated to be
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{S}_{sc} = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{i0}|^2 |E_A (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	Since there is an implied $e^{-\omega t}$ time-dependence, this is added back in to obtain a time-average on the short time-scale ($\omega$ and not $\Omega$). This is
	\begin{equation*}
	\left< \bm{S}_{sc} e^{-i\omega t} \right> = \mathrm{Re}\left\{ \bm{S}_{sc} e^{-i\omega t} \right\} = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{i0}|^2 |E_A (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	If the two frequency components are now considered individually,
	\begin{equation*}
	|E_A^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2 =\frac{\varepsilon_r^2 k^4}{64 \pi^2 r^2} \mathfrak{p}^2 S_0^2 L_x^2 L_y^2 L_z^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	Using standard antenna parameters, the incident field can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	|\bm{E}_{i0}|^2 = 2\eta_0 \eta \frac{P_T G_T}{4\pi R_T^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $P_T$ is the power accepted by the antenna, $G_T$ is the maximum gain of the antenna and $R_T$ is the distance from the antenna to the scattering center. This is inserted into the time-average of the power density, giving
	\begin{equation*}
	\left< \bm{S}_{sc} e^{-i\omega t} \right>^\pm = \bm{\hat{r}} \frac{P_T G_T}{4\pi R_T^2} \frac{\varepsilon_r^2 k^4}{64 \pi^2 r^2} \mathfrak{p}^2 S_0^2 L_x^2 L_y^2 L_z^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	Now the effects of the receiving antenna are considered. It is assumed that this antenna is optimally directed towards the scattering center. The received power is then
	\begin{equation*}
	P_R^\pm = \left| \left< \bm{S}_{sc} e^{-i\omega t} \right>^\pm \right| A_e
	\end{equation*}
	where $A_e$ is the effective area of the antenna, which can be rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
	A_e = \frac{\lambda_R^2 G_R}{4\pi}
	\end{equation*}
	where $G_R$ is the gain of the receiving antenna. $\lambda_R$ should be the wavelength at the antenna here, which is not necessarily the same as in the material. Combining this with earlier results gives a received power of
	\begin{equation*}
	P_R^\pm = \frac{\lambda_R^2 G_R}{4\pi} \frac{P_T G_T}{4\pi R_T^2} \frac{\varepsilon_r^2 k^4}{64 \pi^2 R_R^2} \mathfrak{p}^2 S_0^2 L_x^2 L_y^2 L_z^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	where $R_R$ is the distance between the scattering center and the receiver, and the receiver is located in the direction $(\theta,\phi)$ as seen from the scattering center. For a more traditional bistatic radar equation this can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	P_R^\pm = \frac{P_T G_T G_R \lambda_R^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_T^2 R_R^2}
	\end{equation*}
	with the radar cross-section given by
	\begin{equation*}
	\sigma^\pm (\theta, \phi) = \frac{\varepsilon_r^2 k^4}{16\pi} \mathfrak{p}^2 S_0^2 L_x^2 L_y^2 L_z^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	A more practical measurement than received power is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For this, the average noise power is described as \cite{Young2004}
	\begin{equation*}
	P_n = k_B TB
	\end{equation*}
	where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature and $B$ is the utilized receiver bandwidth. The noise power picked up by the antenna is calculated using the standard temperature $T_0 = 290$ K. The SNR directly at the antenna can thus be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathit{SNR}^\pm_{ant} \frac{P_T G_T G_R \lambda_R^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_T^2 R_R^2 k_B T_0 B}
	\end{equation*}
	After the antenna is the RF front-end which usually contains a bandpass filter, low-noise amplifier (LNA), and mixer. Here the received signal is amplified so that it can be further processed. The amplification affects both the signal and noise, but the electronic components add more noise which causes the SNR to deteriorate. To quantify this, the concept of noise ratio and noise figure is used. The noise ratio is defined as \cite{Young2004}
	\begin{equation*}
	F = \frac{\mathit{SNR}_i}{\mathit{SNR}_o}
	\end{equation*}
	where the SNR's are in linear units, $i$ denotes input and $o$ denotes output. It is more common to use noise figure, which is simply the noise ratio expressed in dB units, $\mathit{NF} = 10\log_{10}(F)$. Most of the noise is added at the RF front-end, so it is usually sufficient to use a noise ratio/figure for that part of the receiver. The SNR after the receiver can now be written using the noise ratio as
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathit{SNR}^\pm = \frac{P_T G_T G_R \lambda_R^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_T^2 R_R^2 k_B T_0 B \cdot F}
	\end{equation*}
	One more effect is added to this, and that is signal integration in the signal processing following the receiver. Noise can often be modeled as a random process, and if multiple samples are added together the noise can be averaged out. If coherent demodulation is used, $N$ samples added together will cause the SNR to improve by a factor $N$ \cite{Richards2012}. The SNR can then be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\textit{SNR}^\pm_N = \frac{P_T G_T G_R \lambda_R^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_T^2 R_R^2 k_B T_0 B F} N
	\end{equation*}
	
	Inspection of the equations for either scattered power or SNR shows that all geometry dependence is contained in the function $\Phi^\pm$. This depends on the observation angles $\theta$, $\phi$ and the angle between EM and Ac. wavevectors $\alpha$. Conditions for the angles maximizing scattering are derived in \ref{sec:app-derivations-bragg} and can be summarized as:
	\begin{align*}
	\theta &= \pi/2\\
	\cos{\alpha} = \mp \frac{q}{2k} &= \mp \frac{\lambda}{2\Lambda}\\
	\phi &= \mp \pi + 2\alpha
	\end{align*}
	The $\mp$-sign here is related to the $\pm$-sign indicating frequency shift of the scattered wave. These equations correspond directly to the Bragg condition used in acousto-optics (see \ref{sec:app-derivations-bragg} for derivation). This gives the model some validation since the acousto-optic Bragg condition is derived from a slightly different starting point, but for the same basic phenomenon \cite{Saleh2007}.

	\section{Derivation of scattering integral for perturbed dielectrics \label{sec:app-derivations-scatter}}
	Here follows a formal derivation of the scattering of electromagnetic waves against a perturbation in relative permittivity. This is useful in photoelastic interaction since an acoustic wave in that case causes a periodic dielectric perturbation. Most of this derivation is based on a similar derivation by Tatarskii which considers scattering from turbulence in air \cite{Tatarskii1971}.
	
	\subsection{General equation for electric field in perturbated dielectric}
	First, Maxwell's equations for a linear, non-magnetic, source-free, isotropic dielectric are presented. Note that the permittivity is not homogeneous.
	\begin{align*}
	&\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{E}} = -\mu_0 \frac{\partial \bm{\mathcal{H}}}{\partial t} \\
	&\nabla \times \bm{\mathcal{H}} = \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{\mathcal{E}})}{\partial t} \\
	&\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{\mathcal{E}}) = 0 \\
	&\nabla \cdot \bm{\mathcal{H}} = 0
	\end{align*}
	The script letters are used here to indicate a time dependence as
	\begin{align*}
	&\bm{\mathcal{E}}(\bm{r},t) = \bm{E}(\bm{r},t) \text{e}^{-i\omega t} \\
	&\bm{\mathcal{H}}(\bm{r},t) = \bm{H}(\bm{r},t) \text{e}^{-i\omega t}
	\end{align*}
	This is used to remove the e$^{-i\omega t}$ dependence in the equations and only keep "slower" time dependencies. The new equations are
	\begin{align*}
	&\nabla \times \bm{E} = i\omega \mu_0 \bm{H} - \mu_0 \frac{\partial \bm{H}}{\partial t} \\
	&\nabla \times \bm{H} = -i\omega \varepsilon \bm{E} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} \\
	&\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{E}) = 0 \\
	&\nabla \cdot \bm{H} = 0
	\end{align*}
	Now $\nabla \times$ is applied to $\nabla \times \bm{E}$ and it is combined with $\nabla \times \bm{H}$, giving
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla \times (\nabla \times \bm{E}) = \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} + 2i\omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} - \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	The relation $\nabla \times (\nabla \times \bm{E}) = -\nabla^2\bm{E} + \nabla(\nabla \cdot \bm{E})$ is now used
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} = \nabla(\nabla \cdot \bm{E}) - 2i\omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Gauss' law $\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \bm{E}) = 0$ is now expanded to $\varepsilon(\nabla \cdot \bm{E}) + (\nabla \varepsilon) \cdot \bm{E} = 0$. This can be rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla \cdot \bm{E} = -\bm{E} \cdot \frac{\nabla \varepsilon}{\varepsilon} = -\bm{E} \cdot \nabla (\ln{\varepsilon})
	\end{equation*}
	Inserting this into the previous equation gives
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon \bm{E} = -\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla (\ln{\varepsilon})) - 2i\omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Now, the dielectric perturbation is defined as
	\begin{equation*}
	\varepsilon = \varepsilon_0(\varepsilon_r + \varepsilon_1)
	\end{equation*}
	where $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\varepsilon_r$ is the unperturbed value for relative permittivity in the material and $\varepsilon_1$ is a small perturbation around $\varepsilon_r$. For $|\varepsilon_1| \ll \varepsilon_r$ $\ln{\varepsilon}$ can be approximated as
	\begin{equation*}
	\ln{\varepsilon} = \ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r) + \ln(1 + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r}) \approx \ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r) + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r}
	\end{equation*}
	Since $\ln(\varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r)$ is constant, the gradient can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla(\ln{\varepsilon}) = \nabla \left( \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r} \right) = \frac{1}{\varepsilon_r} \nabla \varepsilon_1
	\end{equation*}
	This is now inserted in the equation for the electric field together with the definition of the perturbation:
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2\bm{E} + \omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r \bm{E} = \\
	-\omega^2 \mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_1 \bm{E} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - 2i\omega \mu_0 \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \mu_0 \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Now $k$ is defined as $k = \omega/c$ where $c$ is the speed of light in the material
	\begin{equation*}
	c = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r}} = \frac{c_0}{\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}}
	\end{equation*}
	Now the equation for $\bm{E}$ is written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\boxed{
		\nabla^2\bm{E} + k^2 \bm{E} = \\
		-k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r} \bm{E} -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}\nabla(\bm{E} \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - \frac{2ik}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t^2}
	}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Born approximation and solution}
	Now the electric field is split up into an incident field $\bm{E}_i$ and a scattered field $\bm{E}_{sc}$ such that $\bm{E} = \bm{E}_i + \bm{E}_{sc}$. The scattered field is considered to be small compared to the incident field (Born approximation). The incident field then approximately obeys the source-free equation
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2 \bm{E}_{i} + k^2 \bm{E}_{i} = 0
	\end{equation*}
	If this is subtracted from the total equation and $\bm{E}_{sc}$ is neglected in the RHS the resulting equation is
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2\bm{E}_{sc} + k^2 \bm{E}_{sc} =	-k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r} \bm{E}_i -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}\nabla(\bm{E}_i \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - \frac{2ik}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E}_i)}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E}_i)}{\partial t^2}
	\end{equation*}
	This is an inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation which under a Sommerfeld radiation condition has the solution \todo{citation needed}
	\begin{equation*}
	\boxed{
		\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \int_{V_{sc}} \frac{e^{ik |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{4\pi |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \left( -k^2 \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r} \bm{E}_i -\frac{1}{\varepsilon_r}\nabla(\bm{E}_i \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) - \frac{2ik}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E}_i)}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2 \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial^2 (\varepsilon \bm{E}_i)}{\partial t^2} \right) \mathrm{d}v'
	}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Approximation of the integral}
	To simplify this equations even more, approximations concerning the nature of the perturbation can be done. The dielectric perturbation is thus assumed to have the following behavior:
	\begin{equation*}
	\varepsilon_1 (\bm{r},t) = |\varepsilon_1| \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r} - \Omega t)
	\end{equation*}
	where $|\varepsilon_1|$ is the amplitude, $q$ is the acoustic wavevector and $\Omega$ is the acoustic frequency. Furthermore, the relations between wavenumbers and wavelengths are introduced as $k = 2\pi/\lambda$ for electromagnetics and $q = |\bm{q}| = 2\pi/\Lambda$ for acoustics.
	
	Now the terms inside of the parenthesis in the integral are estimated to see which terms are dominant. The terms are denoted $T_n$ where $n$ begins at 1 and is the order in which they appear. Note that these estimations are only to find orders of magnitude. For the first term:
	\begin{equation*}
	T_1 \sim \frac{|\varepsilon_1| |\bm{E}|}{\varepsilon_r \lambda^2}
	\end{equation*}
	For term 2 $\nabla \varepsilon_1 \sim \Lambda^{-1} |\varepsilon_1| \bm{v}$ where $\bm{v}$ is a vector with components $\sim \sin(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r} - \Omega t)$. Then $\nabla (\bm{\hat{E}} \cdot \bm{v}) \sim \nabla(|\bm{\hat{E}}| \sin(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r} - \Omega t)) \sim \nabla(|\bm{\hat{E}}|) + \nabla(\sin(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r} - \Omega t)) \sim \lambda^{-1} + \Lambda^{-1}$. The resulting estimation of the term is then
	\begin{equation*}
	T_2 \sim \frac{|\varepsilon_1| |\bm{E}|}{\varepsilon_r \Lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Term 3 can be expanded using the perturbation definition and the chain rule:
	\begin{equation*}
	T_3 \sim \frac{k}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial (\varepsilon \bm{E})}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{c\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r} \left( \varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r \frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \varepsilon_0\varepsilon_1 \frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \varepsilon_0\bm{E} \frac{\partial \varepsilon_1}{\partial t}\right)
	\sim \frac{1}{c\lambda} \left( \frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} + \frac{\bm{E}}{\varepsilon_r} \frac{\partial \varepsilon_1}{\partial t} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	The derivatives can be approximated as
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial \varepsilon_1}{\partial t} &\sim |\varepsilon_1|\Omega \sim \frac{|\varepsilon_1| v}{\Lambda} \\
	\frac{\partial \bm{E}}{\partial t} &\sim \bm{E} v \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
	\end{align*}
	where $v$ is the speed of sound in the material. The second equation comes from a similar equation in \cite{Tatarskii1971} which takes into account the Doppler effect and changes in $\varepsilon_1$. These are inserted to give
	\begin{equation*}
	T_3 \sim \frac{1}{c\lambda} \left( |\bm{E}| v \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{|\varepsilon_1|}{\varepsilon_r} \right) + \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{\varepsilon_r \Lambda} \right) =
	\frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{c\lambda} \left( \left( 1 + \frac{|\varepsilon_1|}{\varepsilon_r} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right) + \frac{|\varepsilon_1|}{\varepsilon_r \Lambda} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Now, the condition $|\varepsilon_1| \ll \varepsilon_r$, or equivalently, $|\varepsilon_1|/\varepsilon_r \ll 1$ is used to write the the term as
	\begin{equation*}
	T_3 \sim \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{c\lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Term 3 can now be compared with term 1 and 2 to determine the relative sizes.
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{T_3}{T_1} &= \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{c\lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
	\bigg/
	\frac{|\varepsilon_1| |\bm{E}|}{\varepsilon_r \lambda^2} =
	\frac{v}{c} \frac{\varepsilon_r}{|\varepsilon_1|} \left( 1 + \frac{\lambda}{\Lambda} \right) \\
	\frac{T_3}{T_2} &= \frac{|\bm{E}| |\varepsilon_1| v}{c\lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right)
	\bigg/
	\frac{|\varepsilon_1| |\bm{E}|}{\varepsilon_r \Lambda} \left( \frac{1}{\Lambda} + \frac{1}{\lambda} \right) =
	\frac{v}{c} \frac{\varepsilon_r}{|\varepsilon_1|} \frac{\Lambda}{\lambda}
	\end{align*}
	Inspection of these fractions reveals that the condition required for $T_3$ to be neglected is
	\begin{equation*}
	\frac{v}{c} \ll \frac{|\varepsilon_1|}{\varepsilon_r}
	\end{equation*}
	This holds for any ratio between $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$. If $\lambda \gg \Lambda$, $T_2$ will dominate $T_3$. If $\Lambda \gg \lambda$, $T_1$ will dominate $T_3$. If $\lambda \sim \Lambda$, both $T_1$ and $T_2$ will dominate $T_3$. The fourth term on the RHS is similar to the third, but contains a factor $(v/c)^2$. Thus, if $T_3$ can be neglected, so can $T_4$.	The simplified equation if the condition $v/c \ll |\varepsilon_1|/\varepsilon_r$ holds is shown below:
	\begin{equation*}
	\boxed{
		\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_r} \int_{V_{sc}} \frac{e^{ik |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \left( k^2 \bm{E}_i (\bm{r'},t) \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t) + \nabla (\bm{E}_i (\bm{r'},t) \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t)) \right) \mathrm{d}v'
	}
	\end{equation*}
	
	\section{Derivation of radar equation for simple photoelasticity \label{sec:app-derivations-radar}}
	The scattering integral derived in \ref{sec:app-derivations-scatter} is now solved for a simple geometry and material model to obtain a radar equation.
	
	\subsection{Geometry and solution of scattering integral}
	First, the geometry is defined as shown in figure \ref{fig:radareq-geom}.
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\input{scatteringgeom.tikz}
		\caption{\label{fig:radareq-geom} Geometry for the scattering problem.}
	\end{figure}
	The $xy$-plane is defined as the plane formed by the acoustic and electromagnetic wavevectors (they are assumed to be non-parallel). The scattering volume is centered in the origin of the coordinate system, and both the acoustic and electromagnetic waves are approximated as plane waves close to the origin. Thus, the electromagnetic and dielectric perturbation fields near the origin are defined as
	\begin{align*}
	\bm{E}_i (\bm{r}',t) &= \bm{E}_i (\bm{r}') = \bm{E}_{i0} e^{i\bm{k}\cdot\bm{r}'} \\
	\varepsilon_1 (\bm{r}',t) &= -\mathfrak{p} \varepsilon_r^2 S_0 \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t)
	\end{align*}
	Here, $\bm{E}_{i0}$ is the complex field amplitude at the origin ($-i\omega t$ time-dependence separated) and $\bm{k}$ is the electromagnetic wavevector. A scalar photoelastic relation has been assumed, where $\mathfrak{p}$ is the photoelastic constant, $S_0$ is the acoustic strain amplitude at the origin, $\bm{q}$ is the acoustic wavevector and $\Omega$ the acoustic frequency.
	
	For simplicity, the electromagnetic polarization is assumed to be in z, $\bm{E}_{i0} \parallel \bm{\hat{z}}$. This is also in part done to avoid polarization changes in the scattered field \cite{Korpel1988}. Due to this $\nabla(\bm{E}_i \cdot \nabla \varepsilon_1) = \bm{0}$ which simplifies the scattering integral to
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = \frac{k^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_r} \int_{V_{sc}} \frac{e^{ik |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \bm{E}_i (\bm{r'},t) \varepsilon_1 (\bm{r'},t) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{equation*}
	Insertion of the field expressions gives
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = -\frac{k^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_r} \int_{V_{sc}} \frac{e^{ik |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \bm{E}_{i0} e^{i\bm{k} \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathfrak{p} \varepsilon_r^2 S_0 \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{equation*}
	Assuming far-field gives an approximation for the Green-function as \cite{Kristensson2008}
	\begin{equation*}
	\frac{e^{ik |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}| }}{ |\bm{r}-\bm{r'}|} \approx \frac{e^{ikr}}{r} e^{-ik \bm{\hat{r}} \cdot \bm{r}'}
	\end{equation*}
	where $r = |\bm{r}|$ and $\bm{\hat{r}} = \bm{r}/r$. The scattering integral is now written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = -\frac{\varepsilon_rk^2 e^{ikr}}{4\pi r} \bm{E}_{i0} \mathfrak{p} S_0 \int_{V_{sc}} e^{ik ( \bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \cos(\bm{q} \cdot \bm{r}' - \Omega t) \mathrm{d}v'
	\end{equation*}
	The cosine is now written as complex exponentials giving
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = -\frac{\varepsilon_rk^2 e^{ikr}}{8\pi r} \bm{E}_{i0} \mathfrak{p} S_0 \left( e^{-i\Omega t} \int_{V_{sc}} e^{i( k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) + \bm{q} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v + e^{i\Omega t} \int_{V_{sc}} e^{i( k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) - \bm{q} ) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' \right)
	\end{equation*}
	The two integrals are of the same form, $\int e^{i\bm{A} \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v'$, where $\bm{A}$ is independent of $\bm{r}'$. This is solved in general below for the cuboid volume defined by $-L_m/2 \leq m \leq L_m/2$, $m = x,y,z$.
	\begin{multline*}
	\int_{V_{sc}} e^{i\bm{A} \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' =
	\int_{V_{sc}} e^{i\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{x}} x'} e^{i\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{y}} y'} e^{i\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{z}} z'} \mathrm{d}v' =
	\prod_{m = x,y,z} \frac{1}{i \bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}}} \left( e^{i\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}} L_m/2} - e^{-i\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}} L_m/2} \right) \\
	= \prod_{m = x,y,z} \frac{2}{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}}} \sin \left(\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}} \frac{L_m}{2} \right) =
	\prod_{m = x,y,z} L_m \text{sinc} \left( \frac{\bm{A} \cdot \bm{\hat{m}} L_m}{2\pi} \right)
	\end{multline*}
	where sinc$(x) = \sin(\pi x)/(\pi x)$. To apply this result to $\bm{A} = k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) \pm \bm{q}$ this is first simplified using the geometry defined earlier.
	\begin{equation*}
	k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) \pm \bm{q} = k\bm{\hat{x}} - k(\bm{\hat{x}} x + \bm{\hat{y}} y + \bm{\hat{z}} z)/r \pm q(\bm{\hat{x}} \cos{\alpha} + \bm{\hat{x}} \sin{\alpha})
	\end{equation*}
	where r is not written out fully. The solution to the integral with this choice of $\bm{A}$ is now written as
	\begin{multline*}
	\int_{V_{sc}} e^{i(	k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) \pm \bm{q}) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' =
	L_x \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_x}{2\pi} ( k - kx/r \pm q\cos{\alpha} ) \right) \cdot
	L_y \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_y}{2\pi} ( - ky/r \pm q\sin{\alpha} ) \right) \\
	\cdot L_z \text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_z}{2\pi} kz/r \right)
	\end{multline*}
	Changing to spherical coordinates gives:
	\begin{multline*}
	\int_{V_{sc}} e^{i(	k(\bm{\hat{k}} - \bm{\hat{r}}) \pm \bm{q}) \cdot \bm{r}'} \mathrm{d}v' =
	L_x \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_x}{2\pi} ( k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} ) \right) \\
	\cdot L_y \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_y}{2\pi} ( - k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} ) \right)
	\cdot L_z \text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_z}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right) = L_x L_y L_z \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{multline*}
	where all angular dependence has been gathered in the function $\Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)$. This result is now inserted into the scattered field, giving
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc}(\bm{r},t) = -\bm{E}_{i0} \frac{\varepsilon_rk^2 e^{ikr}}{8\pi r} \mathfrak{p} S_0 L_x L_y L_z \left( e^{-i\Omega t} \Phi^+ (\theta,\phi)  + e^{i\Omega t} \Phi^- (\theta,\phi) \right) = -\bm{E}_{i0} E_A(\bm{r},t)
	\end{equation*}
	
	By inspecting $E_A(\bm{r},t)$ it is clear that two frequency-shifted components arise. Since the implied time-dependence is $e^{-i\omega t}$, the factors $e^{\mp i\Omega t}$ give a frequency shift of $\pm \Omega$. The scattered field is written using two distinct components as
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_{sc} (\bm{r},t) = -\bm{E}_{i0} \left( E_A^+ (\bm{r},t) + E_A^- (\bm{r},t) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{equation*}
	E_A^\pm (\bm{r},t) = \frac{\varepsilon_rk^2 e^{ikr}}{8\pi r} \mathfrak{p} S_0 L_x L_y L_z e^{\mp i\Omega t} \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Solution in terms of power}
	This treatment has primarily been focused around the electric field. To obtain a more practical expression, this is now transformed into power. The scattered power density is given by
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{S}_{sc} = \frac{1}{2} \bm{E}_{sc} \times \bm{H}_{sc}^*
	\end{equation*}
	with the magnetic field $\bm{H}_{sc}$ given by
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{H}_{sc} \approx \frac{1}{ik \eta_0 \eta} \nabla \times \bm{E}_{sc}
	\end{equation*}
	where $\eta_0$ is the wave impedance of free space and $\eta_0 \eta$ the wave impedance in the material. An approximation has been made for $k$, where this is assumed to have the same value as before scattering. Since there is a frequency shift this is known to not be the case, but given a small acoustic frequency compared to the electromagnetic frequency, the error is small. The curl of $\bm{E}_{sc}$ is now written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla \times \bm{E}_{sc} = -\nabla \times (\bm{E}_{i0} E_A (\bm{r},t)) = -\nabla E_A (\bm{r},t) \times \bm{E}_{i0}
	\end{equation*}
	In spherical coordinates the gradient is written
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla E_A = \frac{\partial E_A}{\partial r} \bm{\hat{r}} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial E_A}{\partial \theta} \bm{\hat{\theta}} + \frac{1}{r\sin{\theta}} \frac{\partial E_A}{\partial \phi} \bm{\hat{\phi}}
	\end{equation*}
	$E_A$ contains a factor $1/r$, so the two last terms in the gradient will be $\sim 1/r^2$ and are neglected. The gradient is now written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\nabla E_A \approx \frac{\partial E_A}{\partial r} \bm{\hat{r}} = \left( \frac{ike^{ikr}}{r} - \frac{e^{ikr}}{r^2} \right) \frac{\varepsilon_r k^2}{8\pi} \mathfrak{p} S_0 L_x L_y L_z \left( e^{- i\Omega t} \Phi^+ (\theta,\phi) + e^{ i\Omega t} \Phi^- (\theta,\phi) \right) \bm{\hat{r}} \approx ikE_A \bm{\hat{r}}
	\end{equation*}
	where the $1/r^2$ term was neglected. These results are inserted into the expression for the magnetic field, giving
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{H}_{sc} = \frac{1}{ik \eta_0 \eta} (-ikE_A \bm{\hat{r}} \times \bm{E}_{i0}) = \frac{E_A}{ \eta_0 \eta} \bm{\hat{r}} \times \bm{E}_{i0}
	\end{equation*}
	Now, the power density is written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{S}_{sc} = \frac{1}{2} E_A \bm{E}_{i0} \times \left( \frac{E_A}{ \eta_0 \eta} \bm{\hat{r}} \times \bm{E}_{i0} \right)^* = \frac{|E_A|^2}{2\eta_0 \eta} \left( \bm{\hat{r}} (\bm{E}_{i0} \cdot \bm{E}_{i0}^*) - \bm{E}_{i0}^* (\bm{E}_{i0} \cdot \bm{\hat{r}}) \right)
	\end{equation*}
	In the far-field $\bm{E}_{sc} \cdot \bm{\hat{r}} = 0$ and since $\bm{E}_{sc} \parallel \bm{E}_{i0}$ the power density is simplified to
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{S}_{sc} = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{i0}|^2 |E_A (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	Since there is an implied $e^{-\omega t}$ time-dependence, this is added back in to obtain a time-average on the short time-scale ($\omega$ and not $\Omega$). This is
	\begin{equation*}
	\left< \bm{S}_{sc} e^{-i\omega t} \right> = \mathrm{Re}\left\{ \bm{S}_{sc} e^{-i\omega t} \right\} = \frac{\bm{\hat{r}}}{2\eta_0 \eta} |\bm{E}_{i0}|^2 |E_A (\bm{r},t)|^2
	\end{equation*}
	If the two frequency components are now considered individually,
	\begin{equation*}
	|E_A^\pm (\bm{r},t)|^2 =\frac{\varepsilon_r^2 k^4}{64 \pi^2 r^2} \mathfrak{p}^2 S_0^2 L_x^2 L_y^2 L_z^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	To find an expression for $|\bm{E}_{i0}|^2$, the field from the transmitter antenna is written as (adapted from \cite{Orfanidis2016})
	\begin{equation*}
	\bm{E}_T (\bm{r}) = ik\eta_0\eta \frac{e^{ikr}}{4\pi r} \bm{F}_\perp (\bm{\hat{r}})
	\end{equation*}
	where $\bm{F}_\perp$ is the far-field amplitude. Now the coordinate system is not the same as earlier in the derivation! Here it is a spherical coordinate system with origin at the transmitting antenna. This corresponds to a translation in $-\bm{\hat{x}}$ of the original coordinate system. Let $R_T$ be the distance between the two coordinate systems, or equivalently the distance from the transmitter to the scattering center. The direction to the scattering center in this new system is denoted $\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc} = \bm{r}_{sc}/R_T$. Assuming that the orientations of the transmitter and scattering coordinate systems are the same, $|\bm{E}_{i0}|^2$ can be written in the transmitter system as \cite{Orfanidis2016}
	\begin{equation*}
	|\bm{E}_{i0}|^2 = |\bm{E}_T(\bm{r}_{sc})|^2 = \left| ik\eta_0\eta \frac{e^{ikR_T}}{4\pi R_T} \bm{F}_\perp (\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc}) \right|^2 = \frac{k^2 \eta_0^2 \eta^2}{16 \pi^2 R_T^2} |\bm{F}_\perp (\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc})|^2 = 2\eta_0 \eta \mathcal{P}(\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc})
	\end{equation*}
	If the maximum gain $G_T$ of the antenna is in the direction $\hat{r}_{sc}$, it holds that \cite{Orfanidis2016}
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{P}(\bm{\hat{r}}_{sc}) = \frac{P_T G_T}{4\pi R_T^2}
	\end{equation*}
	where $P_T$ is the power accepted by the antenna. This is used to write
	\begin{equation*}
	|\bm{E}_{i0}|^2 = 2\eta_0 \eta \frac{P_T G_T}{4\pi R_T^2}
	\end{equation*}
	Now this is inserted into the time-average of the power density
	\begin{equation*}
	\left< \bm{S}_{sc} e^{-i\omega t} \right>^\pm = \bm{\hat{r}} \frac{P_T G_T}{4\pi R_T^2} \frac{\varepsilon_r^2 k^4}{64 \pi^2 r^2} \mathfrak{p}^2 S_0^2 L_x^2 L_y^2 L_z^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	Now the effects of the receiving antenna are considered. It is assumed that this antenna is optimally directed towards the scattering center. The received power is then
	\begin{equation*}
	P_R^\pm = \left| \left< \bm{S}_{sc} e^{-i\omega t} \right>^\pm \right| A_e
	\end{equation*}
	where $A_e$ is the effective area of the antenna, which can be rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
	A_e = \frac{\lambda_R^2 G_R}{4\pi}
	\end{equation*}
	where $G_R$ is the gain of the receiving antenna. $\lambda_R$ should be the wavelength at the antenna here, which is not necessarily the same as in the material. Combining this with earlier results gives a received power of
	\begin{equation*}
	P_R^\pm = \frac{\lambda_R^2 G_R}{4\pi} \frac{P_T G_T}{4\pi R_T^2} \frac{\varepsilon_r^2 k^4}{64 \pi^2 R_R^2} \mathfrak{p}^2 S_0^2 L_x^2 L_y^2 L_z^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	where $R_R$ is the distance between the scattering center and the receiver, and the receiver is located in the direction $(\theta,\phi)$ as seen from the scattering center. For a more traditional bistatic radar equation this can be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	P_R^\pm = \frac{P_T G_T G_R \lambda_R^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_T^2 R_R^2}
	\end{equation*}
	with the radar cross-section given by
	\begin{equation*}
	\sigma^\pm (\theta, \phi) = \frac{\varepsilon_r^2 k^4}{16\pi} \mathfrak{p}^2 S_0^2 L_x^2 L_y^2 L_z^2 \Phi^\pm (\theta,\phi)^2
	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsection{Signal-to-noise ratio and coherent integration}
	A more practical measurement than received power is signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For this, the average noise power is described as \cite{Young2004}
	\begin{equation*}
	P_n = k_B TB
	\end{equation*}
	where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ is the temperature and $B$ is the utilized receiver bandwidth. The noise power picked up by the antenna is calculated using the standard temperature $T_0 = 290$ K. The SNR directly at the antenna can thus be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathit{SNR}^\pm_{ant} \frac{P_T G_T G_R \lambda_R^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_T^2 R_R^2 k_B T_0 B}
	\end{equation*}
	After the antenna is the RF front-end which usually contains a bandpass filter, low-noise amplifier (LNA), and mixer. Here the received signal is amplified so that it can be further processed. The amplification affects both the signal and noise, but the electronic components add more noise which causes the SNR to deteriorate. To quantify this, the concept of noise ratio and noise figure is used. The noise ratio is defined as \cite{Young2004}
	\begin{equation*}
	F = \frac{\mathit{SNR}_i}{\mathit{SNR}_o}
	\end{equation*}
	where the SNR's are in linear units, $i$ denotes input and $o$ denotes output. It is more common to use noise figure, which is simply the noise ratio expressed in dB units, $\mathit{NF} = 10\log_{10}(F)$. After the RF front-end the signal is often strong enough to not be affected by further noise, so it is usually sufficient to use a noise ratio/figure for that part of the receiver. The SNR after the receiver can now be written using the noise ratio as
	\begin{equation*}
	\mathit{SNR}^\pm = \frac{P_T G_T G_R \lambda_R^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_T^2 R_R^2 k_B T_0 B \cdot F}
	\end{equation*}
	One more effect is added to this, and that is signal integration in the signal processing following the receiver. Noise can often be modeled as a random process, and if multiple samples are added together the noise can be averaged out. If coherent demodulation is used, $N$ samples added together will cause the SNR to improve by a factor $N$ \cite{Richards2012}. The SNR can then be written as
	\begin{equation*}
	\textit{SNR}^\pm_N = \frac{P_T G_T G_R \lambda_R^2 \sigma^\pm (\theta,\phi)}{(4\pi)^3 R_T^2 R_R^2 k_B T_0 B F} N
	\end{equation*}
	
	\section{Geometry for maximum scattering \label{sec:app-derivations-bragg}}
	Let us begin with the $\Phi$ angular dependence function:
	\begin{multline*}
	\Phi^\pm(\theta,\phi) = \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_x}{2\pi} \left( k - k\sin{\theta}\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} \right) \right) 
	\cdot \text{sinc} \left( \frac{L_y}{2\pi} \left( -k\sin{\theta}\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} \right) \right) \\
	\cdot \text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_z}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right)
	\end{multline*}
	The maximum of this function mush be where all sinc-functions are maximum. For a sinc the maximum is given when the argument is equal to 0, which simplifies the process. Firstly, consider the third sinc:
	\begin{equation*}
	\text{sinc} \left( -\frac{L_z}{2\pi} k\cos{\theta} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	The argument of this is obviously zero when $\cos{\theta} = 0$, which for $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ is when $\theta = \pi/2$. This fixes the maximum to the plane formed by the incident electromagnetic and acoustic wavevectors. What it means is that the scattering occurs primarily in one single interaction plane, which simplifies analysis. Now the arguments of the two other sinc functions are set to zero with the value for $\theta$ being set to $\pi/2$:
	\begin{align}
	k - k\cos{\phi} \pm q\cos{\alpha} &= 0 \label{eq:bragg-sinc1} \\
	-k\sin{\phi} \pm q\sin{\alpha} &= 0 \label{eq:bragg-sinc2}
	\end{align}
	
	\subsection{Condition for $\alpha$}
	The system \ref{eq:bragg-sinc1},\ref{eq:bragg-sinc2} is now used to find the angle between wave vectors giving a maximum. To avoid confusion, the positive and negative versions of the system are considered separately.
	
	\subsubsection{(+) case}
	Begin with equation \ref{eq:bragg-sinc1}:
	\begin{equation*}
	\cos{\alpha} = \frac{k}{q}\left( \cos{\phi} - 1 \right) = \frac{k}{q}\left( \pm \sqrt{1-\sin^2{\phi}} - 1 \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Now equation \ref{eq:bragg-sinc2} is inserted in the above as
	\begin{equation*}
	\cos{\alpha} = \frac{k}{q}\left( \pm \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{k^2}\sin^2{\alpha}} - 1 \right)
	\end{equation*}
	This is rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
	\pm \sqrt{k^2-q^2\sin^2{\alpha}} = q\cos{\alpha} + k
	\end{equation*}
	And squared
	\begin{equation*}
	k^2 - q^2\sin^2{\alpha} = q^2\cos^2{\alpha} + 2kq\cos{\alpha} + k^2
	\end{equation*}
	After some simplification, the following equation is obtained:
	\begin{equation}
	\cos{\alpha} = -\frac{q}{2k} \label{eq:bragg-cos+}
	\end{equation}
	Since $q$ and $k$ are non-negative it is clear that $\pi/2 \leq \alpha \leq \pi$.
	
%	\begin{align*}
%	k - k\cos{\phi} - \frac{q^2}{2k} &= 0 \\
%	-k\sin{\phi} \pm q\sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{4k^2}} &= 0
%	\end{align*}
%	Rearranging gives
%	\begin{align*}
%	\cos{\phi} &= 1 - \frac{q^2}{2k^2} \\
%	\sin{\phi} &= \pm \frac{q}{k} \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{4k^2}}
%	\end{align*}
%	The second equation can be further constrained by utilizing $0 \leq \alpha \leq \pi$. This gives $\sin{\alpha} \geq 0$. With $k,q \geq 0$ and equation \ref{eq:bragg-sinc2}: $\sin{\phi} = \frac{q}{k}\sin{\alpha} \geq 0$. Thus, the only valid solution is the positive one. Now, the cos and sin equations are combined into a tan equation:
%	\begin{equation*}
%	\tan{\frac{\phi}{2}} = \frac{1 - \cos{\phi}}{\sin{\phi}} = \frac{1 - \left( 1 - \frac{q^2}{2k^2} \right)}{\frac{q}{k} \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{4k^2}}} = \frac{\frac{q^2}{2k^2} }{\frac{q}{k} \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{4k^2}}} = \frac{q}{2k\sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{4k^2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4k^2-q^2}}
%	\end{equation*}
	
	\subsubsection{(-) case}
	This case is the same as the (+) case, but with some sign changes. Begin with equation \ref{eq:bragg-sinc1}:
	\begin{equation*}
	\cos{\alpha} = \frac{k}{q}\left( 1 - \cos{\phi} \right) = \frac{k}{q}\left( 1 \pm \sqrt{1-\sin^2{\phi}} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Now equation \ref{eq:bragg-sinc2} is inserted in the above as
	\begin{equation*}
	\cos{\alpha} = \frac{k}{q}\left( 1 \pm \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{k^2}\sin^2{\alpha}} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	This is rewritten as
	\begin{equation*}
	\pm \sqrt{k^2-q^2\sin^2{\alpha}} = q\cos{\alpha} - k
	\end{equation*}
	And squared
	\begin{equation*}
	k^2 - q^2\sin^2{\alpha} = q^2\cos^2{\alpha} - 2kq\cos{\alpha} + k^2
	\end{equation*}
	After some simplification, the following equation is obtained:
	\begin{equation}
	\cos{\alpha} = \frac{q}{2k} \label{eq:bragg-cos-}
	\end{equation}
	Since $q$ and $k$ are non-negative it is clear that $0 \leq \alpha \leq \pi/2$.
%	This is now inserted in equation \ref{eq:bragg-sinc1} and \ref{eq:bragg-sinc2}:
%	\begin{align*}
%	k - k\cos{\phi} - \frac{q^2}{2k} &= 0 \\
%	-k\sin{\phi} \pm q\sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{4k^2}} &= 0
%	\end{align*}
%	Rearranging gives
%	\begin{align*}
%	\cos{\phi} &= 1 - \frac{q^2}{2k^2} \\
%	\sin{\phi} &= \pm \frac{q}{k} \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{4k^2}}
%	\end{align*}
%	The second equation can be further constrained by utilizing $0 \leq \alpha \leq \pi$. This gives $\sin{\alpha} \geq 0$. With $k,q \geq 0$ and equation \ref{eq:bragg-sinc2}: $\sin{\phi} = -\frac{q}{k}\sin{\alpha} \leq 0$. Thus, the only valid solution is the negative one. Now, the cos and sin equations are combined into a tan equation:
%	\begin{equation*}
%	\tan{\frac{\phi}{2}} = \frac{1 - \cos{\phi}}{\sin{\phi}} = \frac{1 - \left( 1 - \frac{q^2}{2k^2} \right)}{-\frac{q}{k} \sqrt{1-\frac{q^2}{4k^2}}} = -\sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4k^2-q^2}}
%	\end{equation*}

	\subsection{Condition for $\phi$}
	
	If either of equations \ref{eq:bragg-cos+} or \ref{eq:bragg-cos-} is inserted in the system \ref{eq:bragg-sinc1}, \ref{eq:bragg-sinc2} the following is obtained:
	\begin{align*}
	\cos{\phi} &= 1 - 2\cos^2{\alpha} = -\cos{2\alpha} \\
	\sin{\phi} &= -2\sin{\alpha}\cos{\alpha} = -\sin{2\alpha}
	\end{align*}
	These can be written as
	\begin{align*}
		\phi &=
		\begin{cases}
			\arccos(-\cos{2\alpha}) + 2\pi n &= \pi - 2\alpha + 2\pi n \\
			2\pi - \arccos(-\cos{2\alpha}) + 2\pi n &= \pi + 2\alpha + 2\pi n
		\end{cases} \\
		\phi &=
		\begin{cases}
		\arcsin(-\sin{2\alpha}) + 2\pi n &= -2\alpha + 2\pi n \\
		\pi - \arcsin(-\sin{2\alpha}) + 2\pi n &= \pi + 2\alpha + 2\pi n
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	From these equations it is clear that $\phi = \pi + 2\alpha + 2\pi n$ is the only valid solution. If $\phi$ is constrained to the region $0 \leq \phi \leq 2\pi$ and the previously stated constraints on $\alpha$ are utilized, $\phi$ can be written as
	\begin{align*}
		\phi &= -\pi + 2\alpha \text{ (+ case)}\\
		\phi &= \pi + 2\alpha \text{ (- case)}
	\end{align*}
	
	\subsection{Summary}
	The equations for both the (+) and (-) case are very similar, and can be written in a simple way using $\pm$ signs. The conditions define the geometry which gives the maximum scattering through the angle $\alpha$ between EM and acoustic incident waves and the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ for the receiver direction. They are summarized below:
	\begin{align}
	\theta &= \pi/2 \label{eq:bragg-theta}\\
	\cos{\alpha} = \mp \frac{q}{2k} &= \mp \frac{\lambda}{2\Lambda} \label{eq:bragg-alpha}\\
	\phi &= \mp \pi + 2\alpha \label{eq:bragg-phi}
	%\tan{\frac{\phi}{2}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4k^2-q^2}} &= \pm \sqrt{\frac{\lambda^2}{4\Lambda^2-\lambda^2}} \label{eq:bragg-phi}
	\end{align}
	
	In acousto-optics the interaction occurs in a single plane, which is what (\ref{eq:bragg-theta}) describes. There is also a Bragg condition defining the angle between an acoustic and optic wave which is required for maximum reflection. This is presented in \cite{Saleh2007} as
	\begin{equation*}
	\sin{\theta_B} = \frac{\lambda}{2\Lambda}
	\end{equation*}
	The relationship between the angles in acousto-optics and those used in this model are shown in figure \ref{fig:bragg-comparison} with $\phi_i = \phi_r = \theta_B$ \cite{Saleh2007}. From the figure it is clear that $\alpha = \pi/2 \pm \theta_B$. In this model (\ref{eq:bragg-alpha}) is used to obtain the optimal angle between electromagnetic and acoustic waves, and the transformation between $\alpha$ and $\theta_B$ can be inserted as
	\begin{equation*}
	\cos{\alpha} = \cos(\pi/2 \pm \theta_B) = \mp \sin{\theta_B}
	\end{equation*}
	The RHS of (\ref{eq:bragg-alpha}) is $\mp \lambda/2\Lambda$. This should be equal to the RHS above, which directly gives the Bragg condition.
	
	In acousto-optics it is assumed that the reflection angle equals the incidence angle. This is not directly stated here, but can be obtained by changing from the angles $\alpha$, $\phi$ to the incidence angle $\phi_i$ and reflection angle $\phi_r$ shown in figure \ref{fig:bragg-comparison}. It is clear from the figure that
	\begin{align*}
		\phi_i &= \pm(\alpha - \pi/2) \\
		\phi_r &=
		\begin{cases}
			\phi - \phi_i &\text{ (+ case)} \\
			2\pi - \phi - \phi_i &\text{ (- case)}
		\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
	Now the condition for $\phi_i$ and (\ref{eq:bragg-phi}) are inserted in the condition for $\phi_r$, giving
	\begin{equation*}
		\phi_r =
		\begin{cases}
			-\pi + 2\alpha - (\alpha - \pi/2) = \alpha - \pi/2 = \phi_i &\text{ (+ case)}\\
			2\pi - (\pi + 2\alpha) + (\alpha - \pi/2) = \pi/2 - \alpha = \phi_i &\text{ (- case)}
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
	and thus, the equation for $\alpha$ is also in agreement with acousto-optics. So, from simple variable substitutions the same results as in acousto-optics are obtained. This gives the model some validation since it is in agreement with an already established theory.

%	In acousto-optics there is no separate equation for the scattering angle as in (\ref{eq:bragg-phi}) above. This is simply assumed to be the same as the incident angle, which gives $\phi = \pm 2\theta_B$ (again, see figures 19.1-2 and 19.1-5 in \cite{Saleh2007}). This is inserted, giving
%	\begin{equation*}
%	\tan{\frac{\phi}{2}} = \tan(\pm \theta_B) = \pm \frac{\sin{\theta_B}}{\cos{\theta_B}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\sin^2{\theta_B}}{1-\sin^2{\theta_B}}}
%	\end{equation*}
%	The RHS of (\ref{eq:bragg-phi}) is
%	\begin{equation*}
%	\pm \sqrt{\frac{\lambda^2}{4\Lambda^2-\lambda^2}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{(\lambda/2/\Lambda)^2}{1-(\lambda/2\Lambda)^2}}
%	\end{equation*}
%	If this is compared with the RHS above, the Bragg condition is once again obtained.
%	So, from simple variable substitutions the same results as in acousto-optics are obtained. This gives the model some validation since it is in agreement with an already established theory.
